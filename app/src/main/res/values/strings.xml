    <string name="p1">Book fair is a fair where various types of books are displayed for sale. A book fair is usually held in the month of January and February. In our country it is held in almost all cities and towns. The largest book fair is organized by ‘Bangla Academy’ on the occasion of the 21 February to commemorate the heroic sacrifice of our valiant martyrs. The main purpose of a book fair is not merely sale rather to offer a rare opportunity to assess the advancement made in the publication of books and to analyse recent views compared with previous book fairs . It helps to create new writers as well as new readers. It inspires people to instigate the habit of reading books. A book fair reminds us that books are our best companions. They change our outlook on life and widen our horizon of knowledge. Again we get these best friends at a cheaper rate from a book fair. In order to organize the fair a committee is formed. The committee makes all the arrangements to makes all the arrangements to make the fair successful. There should have arrangements of refreshments. Seminars and cultural programmes should be arranged. Moreover, strict security measures should be taken. The govt. should encourage the writers and the publishers to publish creative books so that the knowledge seekers can satisfy their thirst.

He does not have any permanent work. He usually earns his daily living by doing hard work. He gets up early in the morning and goes out in quest of work. He does different types of jobs such as carrying bricks, wood, stones, mud and digging ponds, constructing of roads, buildings etc. He works hard from morning to evening. He gets his wages at the end of the work. Then he goes to bazar to buy his daily necessaries. He has to work hard in various fields. He is always dependent on his employer. When he earns much money, he and his family can eat well. It is a happy day for them. If he does not find any work, he and his family have to go without food. So the life of a day labour is very miserable. Sorrows and sufferings are his constant companions. He does not know what is joy and happiness. He earns his living by working hard. Most of the time he is ill-paid and ill- treated in every sphere of his life. Infact, the services of a day laborer plays an importance role in our national life. So we should think about his rights and show respect to them.</string>

It dazzles our eyes and soothes our heart. In a moonlit night the moon seems to us like a disk of silver. The moon bathes the whole world with her silvery light. The sparkling stars twinkle around the moon. The surface of water in the rivers, ponds and seas glitter in the light of the moon. They seem to laugh. The whole nature looks bright and appears in divine light. People of all ages enjoy a moonlit night. It is the most pleasant to a newly married couple and lovers. All kinds of people prefer to gossip in the moonlit night. It takes us to the world of imagination. We all like to imagine.

    <string name="p10">A rainy day means such a day when it rains continuously all day long during the rainy season. It is a common sight in our country. It is very dull and gloomy. In a rainy day the sky is covered with thick of black clouds. The sun is not seen in the sky. Sometimes it rains heavily cats and dogs. As a result, rivers, canals and tanks swell up. Roads and paths become muddy and slippery. Water stands here and there. Activities of normal life are stopped due to heavy rain. None can move freely without umbrella from one place to another. The common people cannot attend their respective places in time. If anybody wants to go outside, he has to take an umbrella with him. The poor and the day laborers do not like a rainy day. They cannot go out to earn their living. Their suffering knows no bounds. They go on starving. On the other hand, the rich enjoy the day in listening to music, watching TV, reading novels. A rainy day is most welcomed to the students, as they have no classes in the school. A rainy day brings joyous mood to the young boys of the same age and they are seen to bathe in rainwater with merriment. Those who have imaginary bent of mind enjoy the beauty of nature being drenched in rains. The cloudy sky lets loose their emotions. A rainy day has good effect on the soil. It helps plants to grow, flowers to bloom and nature looks fresh and beautiful. However, a rainy day is not pleasant to all.</string>

The indirect effect of this invisible monster is the downfall and untold suffering of hundreds of thousands of other people who are family members of those victims. A number of factors are responsible for this mishap including the inattentiveness of drivers, the working of a driver over too long a time at a stretch, the bad conditions of the streets, and most importantly, the maudlin competitiveness of the drivers. In Bangladesh, every day we find the news of road accident in our daily newspapers and the screen of television. It really makes us very shocked. Last month I faced such type of pathetic road accident. It occurred in Mirpur road near Kolabagan bus stand. When I was standing on the road and waiting for the bus. Then I saw a little boy who was trying to cross the busy road. When he was crossing the road at that time a bus was coming towards him with a great speed. But within a short time, it ran over the body of the boy and at once the boy was seriously injured. After sometimes when he was taken to the hospital, the doctor declared him death. Really, it made me more pathetic and I cannot forget it easily.</string>

Next he extends his hand in another direction and the traffic on that road comes to a standstill and the stopped traffic on the previous road starts moving on. This goes on for the whole day. A traffic police maintains discipline in roads and highways and plays a vital role in road transports. Some of the traffic police are not well-trained and that‘s why they maintain the traffic whimsically that interrupts the normal speed of all traffics. He does not earn a lot because his salary is very poor. He cannot support his family well and cannot fulfil his desires as he is to lead a very simple life. However, he should be well-paid so that he need not adopt unfair means for his living. Only a few of the traffic police are involved in illegal operations and they unnecessarily halt buses, trucks or any kind of vehicles and demand money illegally.

    <string name="p25">Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals, and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids. Governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions. The chemicals in acid rain can cause paint to peel, corrosion of steel structures such as bridges, and erosion of stone statues.</string>
    <string name="p26">Air pollution means the ways in which the air is polluted. Air is the most important element of human environment. Man cannot live a single moment without air. But we do not think that it is we who pollute this most vital element. Clean air is essential for life. Air is polluted in many ways. For example smoke pollutes air. Man makes fires to cook his food, to make bricks burns refuse, melts pitch for road construction and burns wood. All these things produce heavy smoke and this smoke pollutes air. Another example is that railway engines, power houses, mills and factories use coal and oil. Moreover, buses trucks and cars use petrol and diesel oil. Again all these things create smoke and cause air pollution. Furthermore, the most serious air pollution occurs in big industrials areas where there are many mills and factories. Again serious air pollution also occurs in big cities where there are many buses, trucks and cars playing the street every day. Sometimes men in big industrial area become so sick by inhaling polluted air that they cannot be cured. So, proper measures and steps should be taken to prevent air pollution.</string>

Accident may be of different types. Such as air crushes, motor vehicle accidents, rail accidents etc. They are all dangerous. Some accidents are minor in the sense that they cause less harm than the major accidents. We can here remember the accident of Mrs. Siddiqa Murshed. She hurt herself badly while she was passing near the college pond and became senseless. And there was a crowd around her. Fortunately, Anwar and Kashem two school going boys were passing by the place at that time. They saw the crowd and went there to see what happened. Anwar recognized her as she was the grandmother of Rina, his classmate. He told Kashem to stand there and hurried to Rina’s home to call her mother. Rina’s mother came to the spot with Anwar hearing the news. They took her to the hospital and after several weeks she recovered from her illness. She was lucky and thankful to those young people who acted very responsibly. We should also try to be responsible in our everyday life. </string>
    <string name="p30">Arsenic pollution means arsenic contaminated water. Of late arsenic pollution has become one of the most health hazards in Bangladesh. By drinking arsenic water ,people get the disease. Arsenic is a fatal poison. It has been deposited in that layer of the soil from here our tube-wells pump out water. As a result in most areas of Bangladesh tube-well water in contaminated with arsenic. Arsenic pollution has made the scarcity of drinking water acute though our country is water-rich. The irony of fate is that “water, water everywhere nor a drop to drink.” It is a hard nut to crack. Our ignorant people are drinking arsenic polluted water from tube wells and are human being affected by arsenicosis. Those who do not eat fish and vegetables are easily affected. Arsenic is such a poison that is damages all the vital organs ore after another resulting in the subsequent death o the sufferer. Arsenicosis has no remedy nor has it any antidote. Hence arsenic pollution demands utmost attention. An affected person should drink arsenic free water and take vitamins A,C,E to come round. Arsenic polluted water has been ter5med as the killing water. There has been world wide awareness of this problem. Aids from different corners are reaching. Deep tube wells rainwater, reservoirs, surface water treatment, etc may be the pragmatic measures to minimize the problem to a great extent.</string>
    <string name="p32">There is strong medical evidence that smoking is related to more than two dozen diseases. It has negative effects on nearly every organ of the body and reduces overall health. Smoking is responsible for the cause of preventable death and it has also negative health impacts on people of all ages: unborn babies, infants, children, adolescents, adults, and seniors. Similarly, it leads people to develop health problems like cancer, organ damage, and heart diseases. These diseases limit a persons ability to be normally active. The carbon monoxide produced by passive smoking competes with oxygen for required sites on red blood booths. This reduces the bloods ability to deliver oxygen to the heart and compromises the heart muscles ability to use oxygen. People who smoke cigarettes seem to have a higher risk of death from heart disease (and possibly stroke), but their risk isnt as great as that of cigarette smokers. Studies also show that smokers get more colds, flu, bronchitis, and pneumonia than nonsmokers. And people with certain health conditions become sicker if they smoke; because teens who smoke as a way to manage weight often light up instead of eating, their bodies lack the nutrients they need to grow, develop, and fight off illness properly. Smoking lessens the overall health of smokers. For every premature death caused each year by smoking, there are at least 20 smokers living with a serious smoking-related illness.</string>

    <string name="p34">Bangladesh is rich with various types of foods which enrich our culture and make it familiar among the people of other nations in the world. There are different types of foods in Bangladesh which are totally dissimilar from one another from the side of taste and value. Generally, rice, dal, fish, vegetable and meat are our main dishes and the people of Bangladesh take three meals in a day. In the morning, we take breakfast where the urban people take ruti, porota, biscuit, vegetable, chicken, tea etc. and the rural people take muri, khoi, pitha or stale rice with chilly. In lunch, the people of different range take different foods according to their own choice and demand. Most of the people take rice, dal, vegetable and fish in their lunch. There’s a common saying: “Fish and rice make a Bengali. At the time of cooking our cook uses different types of spices like garlic, peppers, turmeric, onion, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, or mustard seed etc. that make our foods more tasty. In our daily meals we generally take mixed vegetables, fish bhuna, fried okra, Bhorta, fried eggplant, chicken curry, lentils, Egg curry, beef, mutton etc. with rice. Again in our snacks we normally take Paratha, Samosa, Singara, puri, fried roti stuffed with eggs, Naan, Pitha, Mishti Doi and Ras Malai. After taking our meals we usually drink tea, milk and cool drinks. We also take various types of fruits in our leisure time; mango, jack fruits, banana, pine apple, orange, apple, guava, water melon and other seasonal fruits are taken according to the season and choice.</string>
    <string name="p35">Every nation has a culture of its own. Similarly we have an age old and traditional culture of our own. We have our own. Language, dress, food habit , manner of eating , manner of speaking , mode of behavior, games and sports , social values and customs , religion, profession , music , art , literature etc. which are part and parcel of our culture. Though we have a rich culture of our own, we are going to lose some of our culture. Today we are we don’t like folk songs, Zari, Sari, Bhatiali etc. these songs are going to lose their appeal. Today we are fond of band music, Hindi and English song and music. Western culture has both good and bad effect on our society. Western culture has introduced us with the people, society, education, history and culture of the western word. It helps us to make a comparative study between western civilization and ours and to judge the standard of our culture. It also helps to enrich our civilization by accepting the good things of western civilization. The disadvantages of western culture for the society of good Bangladesh are trying to imitate western gross and vulgar abolished soon. As this is the age of globalization, we will not be able to discard western civilization. Rather we should try to imitate what is good in western civilization and give up what is bad in there. </string>
    <string name="p36">Begum Rokeya was a famous writer, a social worker, feminist and a social worker in undivided Bengal in the early 20th century. She is most famous for her efforts on behalf of gender equality and other social issues. She was born in 1880 in the village of Pairabondh, Rangpur, in what was then the British Indian Empire and is now Bangladesh. Her father, Jahiruddin Muhammad Abu Ali Haidar Saber, was a highly educated landlord. Roquia had two sisters, Karimunnesa Khatun and Humayra Khatun; and three brothers, one of whom died in childhood. Roquias eldest brother Ibrahim, and her immediate elder sister Karimunnesa, both had great influence on her life. She believed that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men have in the society. So she fought for their cause throughout her life. She was married to Khan Bahadur Sakhawat Hussain in 1896. Her husband was the Deputy Magistrate of Bhagalpur, now a district in the Indian state of Bihar. He was very cooperative, and always encouraged Rokeya to go on with her activities. Many upper class Muslims of Bengal at that time learnt Arabic and Persian as medium of education and communication. But Rokeya had great love for her mother tongue. She learnt Bangla and English from her eldest brother Ibrahim. She launched her literary career in 1902 with a Bangla story entitled Pipasa (Thirst). Rokea established a high school in her beloved husbands memory, naming it Sakhawat Memorial Girls High School. It started in Bhagalpur, a traditionally Urdu-speaking area, with only five students. She also founded the Anjuman e Khawateen e Islam (Islamic Womens Association), which was active in holding debates and conferences regarding the status of women and education. In her life, she remained busy with the school, the association, and her writings for the rest of her life. She died of heart problems on December 9, 1932. In Bangladesh, December 9 is celebrated as Rokeya Day in her memory.</string>
    <string name="p37">Bird flue is a serious illness that affects that affects birds, especially chickens, that can be spread from birds to humans and that can cause death. Recently the breaking out of bird flue has taken us aback. We could never think of such kind of problem in our country. However thanks to the almighty that it could not break out in an epidemic form because of the timely intervention of the government and people’s consciousness about the matter. The cause of bird flue in our country could not be detected. It was thought that it might have been carried and spread by the imported chickens from our neighboring countries like Thailand and china-because the breaking out of bird flue in an epidemic form has been seen in china and Thailand. Poultry farming has had a positive effect on the socio-economic condition in our country. It helped many rural poor women to break the chain of poverty and fee better days in their lives. But the recent breaking out of bird flue has shadowed their smiling faces into gloomy ones and clouded their foreheads. It has emptied their fertile farms and turned the firms into barren lands. We have seen the heart-rending cries of the people both male and female. Their caries have pierced our hearts. However, it is heartening that our government has taken all-out efforts to give loans to the people engaged in poultry farming on easy terms to keep their income generating industry on and to bring about better days and see the gloomy faces glowing with beatific smile and keep their heads above all consuming poverty. </string>
    <string name="p39">Man made the city and Allah made the country is an old saying. Village life is really different from city life. Firstly, town life is a life of luxury and plenty where village life is simple. Secondly, town life is a busy, Competitive and noisy life. Buses, trucks, cars and other vehicles always ply on and the industries make sound. On the other hand village life is quiet and peaceful. There is no rush and hurry in the village. Thirdly there are air pollution, water pollution and sound pollution in the city. But the village life is free from all the three kinds of pollution. The air is fresh and clean. Fourthly city life offers greater modern facilities of life. In the city schools, madrashas and colleges offer better standard of education. There are Universities and Medical College in cities. There are scopes for trade, and commerce in cities. So the standard of life in a city is higher than in a village. City life offers scope for employment on the country there is no scope of employment facilities in the village. So we can say that there are many differences between life and village life. </string>
    <string name="p40">Climate change is now the most unpredictable threat to our planet. The earth’s climate has changed over the last century. There is stronger evidence that most of the warming observed the last 50 years is due to human activities. Because of gas productions, temperatures should continue to rise over the 21st century.Its impact will be severely negative on both mankind and nature. Human activities that contribute to climate change include in particular the burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and land-use changes like deforestation. These cause missions of carbon dioxide co² the main gas responsible for climate change. And for this possibly many catastrophic changes will be inevitable. The more the greenhouse gases are emitted, the higher the tendency will be for the earth to warm. It will widespread the melting of snow and ice. Serious consequences will be a rise in sea levels, which will endanger coastal areas and small islands. Therefore, only reducing emissions of greenhouse gases should reduce the risk of the adverse effects .Many options for emission reduction is available. But the whole world needs to be concerned to remove this fatal threat.</string>

Again, different kinds of birds are classified into different groups. They are singing birds, talking birds, game birds, tailor birds, migratory birds, domestic birds, wild birds etc. Generally, the birds are divided into two parts – one is seasonal bird and another is common bird. The cow is the most familiar and common bird in Bangladesh. It belongs to the class of teasing birds. It is very ugly to look at. Its voice is harsh too. The Cuckoo, the Doel, the Shayma and The koel are widely known as singing birds. The Cuckoo is noted for its melodious song. It comes at the advent of the spring for which it is called the harbinger of the spring. Doel is our National Bird. Mayna, Shalik, and the Parrot are called talking bird. They can imitate the voice of man when they are trained. The sparrow is another common tiny bird. It annoys us by chirping all the while. It is restless in nature. In summary, the birds play an important role to beautify our country. </string>
    <string name="p42">Man is fond of turning back from the present to the past again and again. The present may be good but the past is golden. Nothing is more pleasant to him than the memories of his childhood, the memories of my childhood haunt me like a passion. Whenever I am sick of the present, I try to get relief in the past days of my childhood. A man cannot remember everything that happened in his childhood. But certain events are stored in the sub-conscious mind. They sometime peep through mind’s eye. I spent my childhood in my native village. When I was six, my father got me admitted into our village primary school where I spent four years. On the first day when I entered the school –compound with my father, the children were enjoying here and there. My mind was troubled with fear, but the warmth with which my classmates received me dispelled all my fears. My heart words put me at ease. The teachers were very helpful. From the very childhood I was extrovert. So I could easily cope with all types of situation. I have so many sweet memories in my early life. My playground was the bank of the mighty Teesta. In all the seasons this river had great attraction for me. Whenever I was not at home, I could be found on its bank. I was very fond of stealing mangoes, lichies, black berries and other fruits in the company of friends in summer. Sometimes we would forget to eat our midday meals. Another interesting memory is the village hat. The hat used to sit twice a weak near a river. I usually went there with some other children. But happy days did not last long. My father got an appointment in a town school and moved there immediately with all the members of the family. The leaving of my native village is the bitterest experience of my life. Though I am now a young man, I still cherish the sweet memories of my happy childhood days spent in the charming environment of my village. </string>
    <string name="p44">A college canteen is a restaurant set up in the college campus to supply food and drink to its students and teachers. Our college begins at 8 am and ends at 4 pm. Most of the students have practical classes of different subjects. We have to stay longer. So it is not possible to pass this long period without taking any snack or tiffin. Moreover sometimes teachers and students come to college without taking breakfast. Here lies the necessity of our college canteen. It is housed in the ground floor of the main building. It is very spacious, neat and clean. The seating arrangement is very fine. There are many chairs and tables to sit and enjoy food. Hot tea, coffee, loaves of bread, banana biscuits, sweets and various kinds of handmade snacks are available. There are two cooks and more some two or three boys to serve us. A manager sits behind the cash box and receives money. During the off period we go there and take tea or coffee and other light tiffin. Thus we remove our tiredness and gain energy. It is a place of rest, friendship discussion and recreation. For all these reasons our college canteen is very favorite to us. </string>

    <string name="p47">Deforestation means cutting down trees in large number. The causes of deforestation are many. Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world. Its population is much more in proportion to its area. This huge number of population needs more shelter, agricultural land, fuel, furniture etc. for all these reasons people cut trees. Moreover there are some dishonest people who cut trees in our forests to make money. The effects of deforestation are too many to describe. This destruction disturbs our ecological balance. The existences of animals are being threatened. Due to deforestation carbon dioxide is increasing worldwide. As a result, the world is becoming warmer. The sea level is rising and many parts of the world are going to be engulfed by the sea in recent future. On the other hand, new areas of the world are turning into deserts as a result of deforestation. The removal if trees cause birds and other animals living on them to leave the place. It also causes serious damage to the soil, as trees give protection to soil as well. In the end, the soil gets sediment in the river bed and causes frequent floods. So, if we destroy trees at random, one day the country will turn into a great desert. All living animals and birds will not find any food or shelter to live in. they will be destroyed. There will animals and birds will not find any food or shelter to live in. they will be destroyed .there will be no rain and as a result our agriculture will face a great crisis. The temperature will rise and it will cause greenhouse effect. The country will be unsuitable for living and various natural calamities like flood, drought, storm etc. will visit our country. Immediate measures should be taken to prevent deforestation. People should be made aware of tree plantation through mass media. Tree plantation programme should be extended throughout the country. Plant more trees campaign must be carried way in this regard. Every man and woman can contribute to this programme by planting at least two trees per head. </string>
    <string name="p48">Dengue fever has been specially identified in recent years. This is an infectious and incurable disease. Its virus is carried by a sort of mosquito. its name is Aedes.

If people keep their environment safe and clean. Aedes can’t grow here and there. If there don’t grow, there will be no fear of attacking dengue fever. Cleanliness is the precondition to save ourselves from the attack of dengue fever.</string>
    <string name="p50">Digital Bangladesh means digitalizing Bangladesh by ensuring an ICT based society where information will be available on line. Here all the possible tasks of government or semi-government will be performed using digital technology. The motto of digital Bangladesh is to establish technology based digital governance, e-commerce, e-agriculture, e-production, e-education etc. The benefits of digital Bangladesh are many. If we can establish a digital Bangladesh, corruption will be reduced radically. It will make people think globally and connect them with the whole world economically, socially, politically, academically and even culturally. It will improve our banking and financial activities. Agriculture, health, education, commerce – all these sections will be highly benefited by making Bangladesh a digital one. To make our country digital first of all, uninterrupted power supply has to be ensured and we have to develop computer network skill and ensure equitable access. Finally, our education should be computer based and in primary and secondary schools students should get easy access to the computer.</string>

    <string name="p54">Environment means the surroundings which are around us. There are many things which pollute the environment. Defunct garbage, carbon- di–oxide, carbon mono-oxide of the engines, different kinds of chemical trash, toxic water and unbearable sound pollute the environment. Our environment is polluted in three ways. Air is polluted by different kinds of poisonous gases. Water is polluted by rotten trash and chemical elements. Sound is polluted when it is used beyond its capable power. Smoke pollutes air by melting pitch, emitting from motor vehicles. Mills and factories pollute water by throwing their industrial discharge into river, cannel. Water can also be polluted by chemicals used for cultivation. City life is becoming ill and unhealthy by environment pollution. Environment pollution is injurious because it affects human lives and world very dangerously. If we want to stop pollution, we shall have to take some effective steps against it. Air, water and sound should be made from all kinds of toxic things and misuse. Now is the best time to raise a slogan, “Save the environment, save the lives.</string>
    <string name="p55">It is true that women have many special tasks in life and their spheres of duties are different from those of men. But we should remember that these tasks also need training and education. Unless women get proper education, all their prospective faculties get crippled. It is only by imparting proper education to them that we can expect them to discharge the duties nicely and decently. Education of children depends a great deal upon mother. Childhood is the most impressionable stage and anything good or bad, thought to child makes a great influence on his mind. Cannot have educated and ideal citizens when the mothers themselves are foolish and ignorant. Every woman is a potential mother. The future of a child depends on how it is brought up and educated in childhood. An educated mother is naturally expected to bring up and educate her children butter than an uneducated mother. </string>
    <string name="p57">A substance added to a food-item to reduce its quality in order to increase its quantity is called as an adulterant. This act of addition of the adulterant in food-items is known as food adulteration. The addition of adulterant may be intentional or accidental. But generally the adulterant addition is intentional. The major reason for the intentional addition of these adulterants is for increasing the profit margin on the expense of the health of the public or consumer. Food adulteration has become a new problem in the country. People do not bother what they are having as foods even they know that it may cause them much harm. Some adulterants enter via agricultural steps, as they are not cleaned well. These are visible adulterants like stones, leaves, soil, sand and dust to name a few. The consumer can clean them and this makes it less harmful. Other adulterants that are intentionally added are invisible or they are made invisible by astutely camouflaging with the color or texture. They are generally harmful for the health and most of them lead to serious health problems like cancer. However, there are hardly any food items from fish to meat, vegetables to milk; biscuits to juice that are not adulterated in one way or another. The hotels and restaurants are also serving these poisonous and unhealthy menus. Different reports show that adulterated foods are causing serious diseases including diarrhea and dysentery round the year. And adulterant reduces the quality of the food and this weakens the health of the one who consumes them, thereby increasing the cost for healthcare. Regular intake of an adulterated food can lead to many health problems. From curable to incurable disorders and diseases can ruin one’s lifestyle and life as well. Recently, the government and general public have been much worried about this issue. The government has set mobile courts to detect and punish dishonest people. And at least some steps are taken by the conscious people of the country. For example, they are trying to avoid some of these foods. But it is not enough. Both the government and public have to work together in order to eradicate this problem. Whatever remains the question and whatever the answer is, understood is the fact is that its a social crime and many are in need of good health. Food adulteration increases the burden of health in the society. So it must be removed from the society.</string>
    <string name="p58">Food pyramid is a chart to show the five groups of foods. There are different types of foods, which we usually take, in each group.The chart tells us how much of each group of food we should eat.If we observe at the base or the bottom of the pyramid we find different types of foods; like breads, cereals, rice, noodles, potatoes, etc. These types of foods are very helpful and healthy. So, we should eat plenty of these foods. Then in the next group we can see some fresh fruits and vegetables. We must eat them regularly. As we go up the pyramid, we find dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurtand meat, fish, beans, nuts and eggs. We should eat these food items moderately because they are important for health we don’t need too much of them. And at the top we have fats, oils, sweets, etc. and we should eat very little of these foods because they are unhealthy.</string>
    <string name="p60">Globalization is, basically, a process of growing trade and commerce all over the world by creating a border less market. However, it is creating more opportunities for capitalist countries rather than for the developing ones. Similarly, in our modern day and age it has become a part of every country’s structure. Again, it is the international exchanges of technology, economy, culture, and politics which have increased over the past few years due to ease of communication and transportation. There are many advantages as well as disadvantages for globalization. With the development of hi-tech communication media and rapid transportation facilities the world has come closer. We can share our joys and sorrows like next door neighbors. Globalization also brings all types of different customs and behavior into our homes through satellite television channels and the Internet. Now, we can enrich our local culture through constant interaction of different cultures. In contrary, In the name of help and co-operation the industrially developed capitalist countries are misusing the cheap labor available in poor countries. This is the common fear about the adverse effects of globalization in the countries like ours. In spite of some disadvantages it makes the world very closer and makes it a global village.</string>
    <string name="p61">A greenhouse is a house made of glass. It has glass walls and a glass roof. People grow vegetables and flowers and other plants in them. A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during winter. During the daylight hours, a greenhouse gets warmer and warmer and stays pretty warm at night too. This is because the heat received from the sun is trapped inside the greenhouse by the glass. The Earth is also like a greenhouse. During the day Earth’s surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, the surface cools releasing the heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These gases, called greenhouse gases, work like the glass walls and the roof and keep the Earth warm. This is global warming and it is making the Earth a dangerous planet. Unfortunately, we are making the earth too hot. We are using oil, gas and coal for running cars, buses, trains, planes, power stations and so on. These fuels have carbon in them. This carbon and other gases trap the heat in the atmosphere and do not allow the earth to cool down. As a result, the Earth gets hotter. As a result of global warming, the ice on the Earth’s surface is melting fast due to extreme heat. Oceans and seas are warming too. All the ice that melts will fill up the oceans and seas and they will overflow on land. Thus a huge area of land will go under water. Some of the best land for growing food is also the most low-lying. That means it will be flooded first. Even some big cities like London, Kolkata and Bangkok will get flooded. That means thousands of people will lose their houses and land and they will go hungry. Moreover, as the earth’s climate warms up, the weather gets more violent. Storms and cyclones will become more powerful. More areas will get drier and turn into deserts. There will be heavier rains too. So there will be more floods and river erosions.</string>
    <string name="p62">In recent years, there have been many alarming reports that the world’s climate is undergoing a significant change. All these reports provide strong evidence that world temperatures are increasing day by day. This increase is known as global warming caused by increased amounts of carbon dioxide around the earth. Most climatologists believe that the greenhouse effect is the most likely cause of this global warming. Climatologists predict that by midway through the next century temperatures may have risen by as much as 4 degree c. this could catastrophically reduce mankind’s ability to grow food , destroy or severally damage wildlife and wilderness, raise sea levels and there by flood coastal areas and farmland. The alarming news about Bangladesh is that as a result of the rise of the sea level the lower southern part of the country may one day go under water. The main culprits for global warming are carbon dioxide gas, produced by the burning of fossil fuels and forests and being careful and raising public awareness.	</string>
    <string name="p63">Honesty means integrity that is an intangible virtue and it is one of the finest traits that bring distinction between man and beast. An honest man is an asset of a family, society, country and the world. An honest man must be a straightforward guy who would do everything without mingling true and false. He is almost like a soothe saver who could even die for the cause of truth. Often, he faces problems and hardship in life, but his honest tendency and policy always strengthen him to go against the “sea of troubles”. He never compromises with the Evil doers. His honest policy always brings glorious out-come for himself and for his family, society and country. Everybody trusts him for his authentic policy and so, he entrusted with important duties. And thus, an honest man is an emblem of humanity. The same evaluation comes from the text under the title of “Honesty is the best policy”. There a story by Mr. Anis Ahmad goes like this honest man was appointed as a caretaker of a big mango orchard. He worked for years but didn’t take the test of any single mango. This was proved when the owner of the orchard once, asked him to bring sweet mangoes to entertain his friends. Although at first, he was scolded, by the owner for bringing sour mangoes, later he was rewarded by the same man. In fact, it was teaching for Bahadur, an old bearer of a school garden for his honesty. He was so moved by the story that he admitted his guilt because of being ushered the right way by this very policy. </string>
    <string name="p65">There is no doubt that health is wealth. A wealthy man with poor health cannot enjoy his life. So, all his wealth is useless for him. Money cannot buy health and happiness. For a student good health is must as to study regularly and he has to be fit enough. Therefore, to keep a good heath man has to take balanced diet as well as take regular exercise. He must drink pure water. Surely, if the mind and body goes well he will find to do everything well. On the other hand, a poor man with good health can enjoy life where a rich man with poor health cannot enjoy a sound sleep. He cannot enjoy good food and he spends his life under many defenses. Again, a poor but healthy man lives a better life and he can work hard, similarly enjoy a sound sleep. He does not spend sleepless and restless nights. He can eat whatever he wishes. Thus, a poor but healthy man can live a better life than a rich but sick man.</string>
    <string name="p67">Internet is a computerized network of information. It is the greatest invention in the communication system. It is the worldwide network of computer. Its uses and functions are smooth, easy and rapid. A students who knows just the keys of computer, can communicate anywhere he wishes. Internet communication is now the latest communication in the world. A computer and a telephone connection are required to get an Internet connection. There are two types of Internet such as Dial up and Broad Band. Internet has great usefulness. To get appropriate information a person has to communicate in the appropriate address. One can also go to a search engine like Yahoo, Goggle for finding particular page or a piece of information. A search engine is a system through which you can search for information on Web pages containing that information. By using Internet students can go through several books from the libraries without going there. They can seek information regarding admission to different foreign universities. But it is a matter to sorrow that many people of Bangladesh do not have still access to Internet because it is still costly and not easily available.</string>
    <string name="p68">The 21st February is an international mother language day. Mother tongue is a divine gift. From the hole Quran we come to know that the most merciful almighty has bestowed a mother tongue upon each and every caste, creed and colour. Mother tongue is so important that the people of a country express their ideas, thoughts, feelings emotions etc., clearly through mother tongue. But it is an iron of fate that the then rulers of Pakistan tried to impose Urdu as the state language upon us instead of Bangla. But the people of our country raised their voice against the unlawful decision. Some of the heroic sons came forward and sacrificed their glorious life for the cause of our mother tongue on the 21st February 1952. Rafique, Jabbar, Salam, Barkat were shot. Since then this day called the shaheed dibash. Every year we remember this day with solemnity and pay them profound tribute. This day has got international recognition in 1999. Now this day is observed all over the world. So it is a matter of great glory and prestige for us. </string>
    <string name="p69">Load shedding means the discontinuity of supply of electricity for short or long time. Nowadays it has become a part of our daily life. There are many reasons for load shedding. The insufficient production of electricity is the main reason of it. Misuse and illegal connection of electricity are the other reasons of it. It occurs mostly at night because the demand of electricity is more than in the daytime. The bad effects of load shedding are beyond description. It creates problem in the socio-economic development of the country. Mills and factories, shops, hospitals etc. become paralyzed due to load shedding. The sufferings of the students know no bounds. They sit in the darkness closing their books during the load shedding. They suffer a lot of if it occurs in the time of their examination. The patients also suffer terribly because operation stops in hospitals for load shedding. Load shedding at night also encourages the thieves. However, this problem should be solved at any cost. The concerned authority must take necessary steps to stop it. More power stations should be established. Illegal connection and system loss should also be stopped.

May day means first May of the year, which is recognized as the international workers who laid down their lives for the interest of the workers in Chicago in May 1886. The history is that during those days the working people were suffering from over work. From the beginning of the industrial Revolution people in factories have worked very long, shifts lasting up to fourteen or even more hours a day. They could not protest for fear of losing job. However, they protested against the injustice done to them. And on May 3,1886 police fired into a protestant crowed in Chicago. The street of Chicago were smeared with the warm blood of workers. Many people were injured and one died. All the privilege workers enjoy to day such as a minimum wage, safety laws and eight-hours workday were the outcome of the sacrifices of the workers on May3,1886. These are the rights they have achieved by their struggle. This day reminds the working class people that the workers will continue to be exploited until they stand up and speak and speak out to gain much better working condition, better pay and standard of life. On this day the working classes of the world become united irrespective of castes, creeds and nationalities. This is the glory as well as sorrow. So black flags are flown atop the offices and black badges are worn by the workers to symbolize their heartfelt grief for their fellow workers. Thus May Day has been a symbol of unity for the workers all over the world.</string>

But we should change our notion of secure and comfort able job in an office or bank because there are more people in our country than jobs.

The youths should not remain idle after completing their studies. They should remember that self help is the best help. They can easily engage themselves in various sectors of self employment. Agricultural farming, poultry raising, fish cultivation, livestock rearing are some of the sectors. The government and different NGOs are working relentlessly for providing the youths with training in various vocational activities.

    <string name="p79">Food is very important for our body because we cannot live without it. We should eat nutritious food. It must contain natural elements that our body needs to grow properly. My favorite food is custard. It is very easy to prepare. I can prepare it myself. Often I have it in the evening. We need to drink milk everyday. Milk is rich in calcium. It’s good for our healthy growth. It makes our bones and teeth strong. We must eat fruits. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals. They keep our body free from dieses. They are also good for our skin and health. In order to make custard, we need milk and some kinds of fruits, such as Mango, Banana, Apple etc. So milk is very important delicious and nutritious food.

    <string name="p80">Mr Turan , our English teacher, is my favorite teacher. I like him very much for some of his extra- ordinary qualities. His method of teaching is outstanding. His art of speaking is also very appealing. I become spell bound when I listen to him. His pronunciation is so clear that students can understand his lecture easily. Besides, he takes care of every student in such a manner that everyone, regards him as an intimate one. Moreover, he is rude to none, rather he treats all very politely and equally. He is also very co-operative. If a student fails to understand any term, he helps understand it again and again. He leads a very simple life. I hardly find these qualities in other teachers. Following him, I would like to be a teacher like him. I am very proud of my favorite teacher.   </string>
    <string name="p24">Academic friend is a friend with whom we can share our study related tasks, solve the problem and part with different types of thinking which are supportive for developing our skills. Academic friend may be one or more. With an academic friend we can share not only academic objects but also others. Thus, every student has to keep an academic friend to fulfill his skills and reach his destination within a perfect time. Moreover, discussion with an academic friend makes a student self-confident, more brilliant and active. Similarly, it widens the thinking power, outlook, generosity and artfulness of a student. Again, it helps him to utilize his time properly, be punctual and be supportive. As a result, a group discusser can easily learn how to develop both his society and nation. Therefore, every student should keep an academic friend to become a good student and contribute much contribution of his nation. </string>

The necessity of learning English can not be described in words. To get a good job, English is must. Besides, to run business with any country, English is the only language of communication.

    <string name="p84">The necessity of education cannot be over-stated. Education is one of the basic needs of human being. It is also essential for any kind of development. The purpose of education is to enlighten the individual and develop his/her capacity to the limit. It helps us distinguish between right and wrong. It enables us to make the right choices in life and to perform our duties properly. It ennobles our mind and refines our sensibility. In this way education can really remove the darkness of ignorance. Besides, education broadens our outlook. It promotes humanity and universal brotherhood. Thus education promotes understanding among people of all climes. Education can be used as catalyst for a change for the better. Education provides us with the knowledge of health, sanitation and population control. It also enhances our ability to raise crops, increase industrial production, store food, protect the environment and carry out our social responsibilities. Thus education contributes enough towards a change for the better and its necessity can more be felt than described.</string>
    <string name="p92">Seasons change with the change in nature. Summer, Rainy, Winter and Spring are the seasons in our tropical continent. The summers are so hot that people eagerly wait for the monsoon. The rains bring relief. The winters are cold and many parts of northern India experience snow fall. The ‘queen of seasons’ ,Spring is also the ‘season of festivals’. Every season has its own characteristic features.During summer season the intense hear and the scorching sun rays are  a cures. People prefer to stay indoors. Many areas face the problem of water scarcity. Almost every year during summers epidemic breaks out. But despite the various draw backs of the summer season, it is the season I like most.The end of the Spring is the beginning of summer. I welcome this change as it is the sign of fast approaching summer vacations. These holidays are always awaited. They are a relief from the heavy book load, tedious study schedule of school ,l difficult assignments and brain raking examinations. Holidays means no fixed  routine and I can spend my time as I please.Playing and splashing in the cool waters of the swimming pool in the company of my friends  is what I enjoy most.Many delicious fruits come only in this season. Watermelons, grapes and the king of fruits-mangoes are my fond temptations. I love ice-cream. As there is little fear of cold and coughs  I eat plenty of it. Nothing can hold me back from cold coffee with ice-cream and ice-cream soda. Thanks to summers, I can fulfill all my desires in taste.In fact, the summer season is the time when I can be my own self and I enjoy its every moment.</string>
    <string name="p11">Rainy season starts in India in the month of July when winds of South West Monsoon starts blowing. According to the Hindi month it falls in Asadha and Shawan. Everyone enjoy it a lot as environment becomes so clear, cool and clean because of the fresh air and rainy water. Plants, trees and grasses become so green and look very attractive. New leaves are arising to the plans and trees as they get natural water after a long time of hottest summer. The whole environment gives a greenery look all around which is very nice for the eyes.Rainy season brings my lots of favourite festivals like Raksha Banhan, 15 August, Teej, Dussehra, etc. We also enjoy eating lots of fresh fruits and well ripe mangoes in this season. I never want to lose this season. My mom cook lots of delicious dishes (such as pakaude, edli, halwa, tea, coffee, sandwich, etc) to us while its raining.</string>
    <string name="p87">Population is an unbearable burden for Bangladesh. Bangladesh happens to be the most densely populated country in the world. In an area as small as 555981 square miles, Bangladesh has a population of over 130 million. About 1500-1600 people live in one square mile. Every year more than two million people are being added to our population. The problem is now out of control. It has reached the position of explosion.Although the population of a country is an asset, it becomes a problem when the country cannot afford to provide its people with the basic necessaries of life.The area of Bangladesh is too small to support its vast population. As a result over-population creates a lot of critical problems involving communication, education, employment, housing, health, medical treatment, environment etc. All these problems eventually lead to a general problem named poverty.  Hence, it could be safely said that the poverty of our country is largely an aftermath of its population problem.We all should come forward to control it. The government of Bangladesh has already taken a number of steps regarding the issue. In order to overcome this problem, we may follow the following rules. Each family must not have more than two children. Then each family will be planned. Each family should be made aware of the gravity of the problem.</string>

    <string name="p82">Nelson Mandela was born in Mvezo, South Africa on 18 July 1918. He was in the forefront anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. In 1964 he was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent to Robben Island and released from the prison in 1990 after 26 years. In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (along with F.W. de Klerk). In 1994 he became the first democratically elected president of South Africa. On 5 December 2013 he passed away. In 2009, the United Nations declared 18 July— the day Nelson Mandela was born — as "Nelson Mandela International Day" in recognition of Mandela’s contribution to the global peace and freedom. The objective of celebrating Mandela is to spread the message that each individual has the ability and the responsibility to change the world for the better, thereby to build a global movement for good. The day was launched to recognize his contribution to the struggle for democracy internationally and the promotion of a culture of peace throughout the world.He said, “What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead”. If everyone of us heeds the call to simply do good every day, we would be living Nelson Mandela’s legacy and helping to build a world of our dreams.</string>
    <string name="p53">E-learning refers to the use of electronic media and information and communication technologies (ICT) in education. E-Learning is the use of technology to enable people to learn anytime and anywhere. E-Learning can include training, the delivery of just-in-time information and guidance from experts. E-learning includes numerous types of media that deliver text, audio, images, animation, streaming video, audio or video tape, satellite TV, CD or DVD-ROM and computer-based, as well as web-based learning. E-learning can occur in or out of the classroom. It can be self-paced or instructor-led. It is commonly thought that new technologies make a big difference in education. Many people involved in e-learning believe that everyone must be equipped with basic knowledge of technology, as well as use it as a vehicle for reaching educational goals. Various technologies are used to facilitate e-learning. Most of the e-learning uses combinations of many techniques, including blogs, collaborative software, Portfolios, educational websites and virtual classrooms-Learning has become an important technique that educational as well as business institutions invest a great deal of money, time and effort in order to make use of it. E-Learning has proven to be the cheapest way to transmit knowledge to the largest number of people regardless of their location and their devices. Most of the existing e-Learning environments present some similarities and most educators need several tools to efficiently make use of e-Learning. In short, e-learning has helped people to learn about anything they want, anytime they want by using modern technologies and thus spreading knowledge all around the world. Nowadays, people are often motivated to educate themselves on new topics, but do not necessarily have time to take a full course. Actually, they often refer to the Web to search and gather enough information about a topic to be able to complete a task or carry on a discussion. Hence comes the word e-learning.</string>

    <string name="p98">Zoo is a place where different animals and birds are kept. Zoo is a great attraction for children. Last Sunday I went to see the zoo with my parents. It is situated at Purana Qila in New Delhi. We bought the tickets and went inside. Many people had already come to see the animals and birds. First of all, we saw a lion. It was grand and royal. Then we saw some tigers. Then we went to the enclosures of leopards, elephants, bears and foxes. Then we went to see the monkeys and some birds. The monkeys were jumping from one branch of the tree to another. Some monkeys were eating bananas. The birds in the zoo were very beautiful. I was very happy to see the birds. I saw some birds for the first time. Then we moved to a tank. It was full of crocodiles. We also saw some other water birds like ducks and cranes. We then saw snakes such as pythons and cobras. We spent six hours in the zoo and then came back. We enjoyed a lot in the zoo.</string>

    <string name="c14"><![CDATA[There is a wise saying, “A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder.” This saying stresses the necessity of having a definite aim in one’s life. It is true that an aim keeps a man steady in life and encourages him to go ahead.

Every person has his own taste and ambition. Every person has his own likes and dislikes. Some students want to be engineers, some want to be teachers, some aspire to be members of the civil service and some choose medical profession as their career. Some others want to be journalists and writers and some dream of becoming scientists. The choice of profession depends on one’s aptitude and innate propensities.

At present I am a student and am prosecuting my studies at a high school. So I have still a long way to go in life. However, I have a definite aim. My aim is to live my life well and make the world a little better than today. To be able to do this I wish to dedicate my life to science, that is, I want to be a scientist. I shall take up work in a college or a university and devote myself to research in science. I hope that it will be possible for me some day to make some useful discoveries. I can at least pave the way for new discoveries for the next generation.

Science adds to the joy of life. It removes poverty. It lessens human sufferings. Countries which are advanced in science enjoy prosperity. So if I can advance science in my poor, backward country, I shall consider my life well spent.

When I grow up I shall have to do my duty to my family. For this I shall have my salary which should be enough to meet my needs. No scientist indeed no great man, has ever cared for excessive amount of money. He has lived for work. His motto has, throughout the ages, been “plain living and high thinking.” So is mine and I hope of reaching my aim with all my efforts as well as with the blessing of God.]]>

    <string name="c4"><![CDATA[A journey is always a pleasure to me. But I always prefer a journey by boat to a journey by train or a bus. A journey by boat is very interesting and exciting. It is more enjoyable than any other journey. A few days ago, I made a journey by boat. It gave me immense pleasure and a lot of entertainment.

It was the month of July. The rainy season had just set in. My elder brother suggested that we should pay a visit to the Heritage Park at Ashulia. I knew that it was possible to go there by boat. So I persuaded him to go there by boat. And all my family members agreed to my proposal. On the appointed day we went to Sadarghat and hired a boat. The boat we hired was very nice but not so big. In the boat these were one helmsman and two oarsmen. It was about 10 a.m. when we started.

The boatman began the journey with shouts of “Badar, Badar.” The boat was crossing the Buriganga to pass into the river Torag. The river bank with large buildings, boats and the people bathing in the river presented a beautiful sight. The boat was going against the current. The banks of the river looked green with paddy fields. The scenery was very pleasant. Many boats loaded with passengers or goods were sailing up and down. At about 1.p.m. we stopped at a bazaar and took our tiffin.

After about half an hour we started our journey again. Now the wind was blowing strongly. Patches of dark clouds were seen together in one end of the sky. We were very much alarmed at what we saw. My younger sister started crying. My mother was trying to keep her quiet. The boat man also consoled us. Then they set sail. The boat now began to cut quickly through the water. We had crossed the river before the storm set in. After a journey of about six hours we reached our destination.

The journey by boat that I made a few days before was really very interesting and exciting. I enjoyed the journey very much. It gave me so much pleasure that I remember it every moment and even while me dream.

    <string name="c5"><![CDATA[A journey is pleasant to all. A journey by train is especially very pleasant and enjoyable to me. A few days ago I made a journey by train from Dhaka to Chittagong.

During the last vacation one of my friends requested me to attend his sister’s marriage ceremony at Chittagong. So I got a chance to make a journey by train. I accepted this invitation gladly.

Two other friends joined with me. On the fixed day we reached Kamalapur Railway Station at 07:00 A.M. The station was very crowded. Somehow we managed to buy our tickets. With great difficulty we got into the train. Fortunately I got my seat beside the window. After a few minutes the guard blew the whistle and the train began to move on. At first the train moved on slowly. There it began to run in full speed.

I kept looking outside through the window. The train was passing through the green fields. Dew drops on green grasses were glittering like pearls. Trees and houses seemed to run behind. We saw the farmers working in the field. Cattle were grazing here and there. I enjoyed the scenes with cheerful mind. The train stopped at a few big stations. We bought boiled eggs, bananas, and magazines etc. from the hawkers. When the train started from Feni Station, I saw the hills of Chittagong. On the right I saw the vast sheet of water of the Bay of Bengal. All these pleased me very much.

At last, the train reached Chittagong at 02:00 P.M. We got down from the train and saw my friend at the station. He came to receive to us. He became very pleased to see us.

It was the most pleasant journey in my life. I enjoyed it so much that the memory to the journey will remain ever fresh in my heart.

    <string name="c11"><![CDATA[A village fair is a large gathering of men, women and children on a particular occasion. It is a hilarious annual meeting place of the village people. It is like a mirror that reflects the emblem of rural life. It brings a chance in the monotonous life of the villagers. People of all ages specially the children eagerly wait for this happy occasion.

A village fair is usually held once or twice a year either on the first or the last day of Bengali year. It is also held on the occasion of some religious or national festival. It is generally held in the central part of the village or on the bank of a river or in front of a Temple or a Dargah or under the spreading big banyan tree.

A village fair is an exhibition of the village products. The people of different professions in the village such as a patterns, carpenters, blacksmiths, weavers etc. bring their own hand made articles for sell and display. There is a great assemblage of fancy goods such as toys, whistles, combs, hair pins, cheap ornaments, cosmetics, looking glasses, earthen wares, balloons etc. in the fair. Different kinds of household goods and decorated and painted articles of bamboo, wood and cane are also brought for sale. Various kinds of sweet meats and seasonal fruits are also available here. Everybody buys things after his own choice.

A village fair is a place of joy and pleasure for the villagers. As such some special and attractive arrangements are made in the fair to attract and amuse the visitors. Circus, Magic show, Jatra and Jarigan are the chief attractions of them in the fair. Merry-go-rounds, puppet shows, mock fights, the lotteries etc. are some other special attractions of the fair.

The village fair has some drawbacks too. As it lacks in arrangements for proper sanitation, it sometimes leads to the outbreak of epidemics. The gambling parties in the village fair tell upon the morality of the village people, besides subjecting them to economic loss. Moreover, undesirable people and criminals visit the fair and commit various kinds of mischief.

Rural people are deprived of different kinds of amenities of life enjoyed by the urban people. So, a village fair appears before the villagers with all opportunities for joys and pleasures. It gives them much relief to their toilsome life. On the whole the village fair has not outlived their utility even now. It is a part or our cultural life.

    <string name="c12"><![CDATA[A village market is public places in a village where the influx of people assemble from adjoin areas to buy and sell commodities necessary for everyday life. So, it is an important buying and selling center for the villagers. It is the back-bone of the rural economy.

A village market generally locates at a place where people from different places can easily come for buying and selling different goods. So, a village market usually stands by the side of a river or canal or at the junction of roads or near a railway station.

There are generally two kinds of village markets—the daily market and the weekly market. The daily market is called bazar. It sits daily in the morning. The weekly market is called hat. It sits once or twice a week in the forenoon and continues up to late in the evening.

The shops in a village market are arranged in a systematic way. Generally three types of shops are seen in the village market. They are permanent shops, temporary shops and open space shops. The open space shops of the same kind are clustered together and are arranged in rows. Fish, milk, fruit, betel leaves, vegetables etc. are bought and sold in the open space shop. The temporary shops are held in sheds having only their roofs. In these shops oil, rice, salt, pepper, spices etc. are sold. Some grocers, tailors, cloth dealers, stationers and tea-sellers have permanent shops. There are different sections of the village market. They are generally known as fish market, vegetable market, rice market, fruit market, and so on. The fish and vegetable markets are the most crowded place in the market. Haggling is one of the main characteristics of a village market. Nothing is sold without haggling.

The village market is of great use and importance the villagers. Here they get all the necessary things of their daily use. As such they need not go to distant places to buy and sell things.

Apart from its practical utility, it has also its social value. If brings the people of different villagers closer and thus strengthens the bond of their unity. It is an important place for village politics and a place of entertainment for the villagers too. There are some people who come here only to pass a pleasant time in roaming about.

The village market is an unhealthy place. It is dusty in the dry season and muddy in the rainy season. There is no proper system for disposing the garbage and other filths. It lacks in proper sanitation too.

Though the village market is a noisy, dusty and unhealthy place, yet it is an integral part of village life. It is a place of gathering of a vast number of people providing opportunities for views and news let alone buying and selling daily necessaries. Proper care and arrangements should be made for the improvement of the unsatisfactory condition of the village market.

    <string name="c15"><![CDATA[It is defined as the act of throwing acid onto the body of a person with the objective of injuring or disfiguring out of jealousy or revenge. Perpetrators of these attacks throw acid at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones. The long term consequences of these attacks include blindness and permanent scarring of the face and body.

These attacks are most common in Cambodia, Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan and other nearby countries. Globally, at least 1500 people in 20 countries are attacked in this way yearly, 80% of whom are female and somewhere between 40% and 70% under 18 years of age.

ATTACKS IN SOUTH ASIA
In South Asia, acid throwing attacks have been used as a form of revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of marriage and demands for dowry. Scholars Taru Bahl and M.H. Syed say that land disputes are another leading cause.

AFGHANISTAN
In Afghanistan in November 2008, extremists subjected schoolgirls to acid attacks for attending school. Attacks or threats of attacks on women who failed to wear hijab or were otherwise immodestly dressed have been reported in Afghanistan.

BANGLADESH
In Bangladesh, where such attacks are relatively common, they are mostly a form of domestic violence. The Acid Survivors Foundation counted 91 attacks in Bangladesh in 2011. The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. According to Mridula Bandyopadhyay and Mahmuda Rahman Khan, it is a form of violence primarily targeted at women. They describe it as a relatively recent form of violence, with the earliest record in Bangladesh from 1983. The scholar Afroza Anwary points out that acid violence occurs not only in Bangladesh but also in Pakistan, China, and Ethiopia and has occurred historically in Europe.

CAMBODIA
In Cambodia, it was reported that these attacks were mostly carried out by wives against their husbands, lovers.

GAZA
In 2006 a group in Gaza calling itself Just Swords of Islam claimed to have thrown acid at a young woman who was dressed immodestly, and warned other women to wear the hijab.

INDIA
The Thomas Reuters Foundation survey says that India is the fourth most dangerous place in the world for women to live in as women belonging to any class, caste or creed and religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim her permanently and act as a lesson to put her in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a mans proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap and easily available and is the quickest way to destroy a womans life. The numbers of acid attacks have been rising in India and there have been 68 reported acid attacks in the state of Karnataka since 1999. Most of the female victims suffer more because of police apathy in dealing with cases of harassment as that of a safety issue as they refused to register a police case despite the victim being attacked thrice before meriting police aid after an acid attack. One such incident would be Sonali Mukherjees case where the perpetrators were granted bail after being sentenced to nine years of Jail. Thereafter, when her family approached High Court, all the legislators, and MPs in search of justice, all she got in return was assurances and nothing else. The perpetrators got away scot-free.

Indian acid attack survivor Shirin Juwaley founded Palash Foundation to help other survivors with psycho-social rehabilitation. She also spearheads research into social norms of beauty, speaks publicly, and blogs regularly at Do I Look Normal? In 2011, the principal of an Indian college refused to have Juwaley speak at her school for fear that Juwaleys story of being attacked by her husband would make students become scared of marriage. Tom ONeill of National Geographic reported that acid throwing is also used to enforce the caste system in modern India.

PAKISTAN
According to New York Times reporter Nicholas D. Kristof, acid attacks are at an all time high in Pakistan and increasing every year. The Pakistani attacks he describes are typically the work of husbands against their wives who have dishonored them.

According to another New York Times article, in 2011 there have been counted 150 acid attacks, after 65 in 2010.

LEGISLATION
In 2002, Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for throwing acid and laws strictly controlling the sale, use, storage, and international trade of acids. The acids are used in traditional trades carving marble nameplates, conch bangles, goldsmiths, tanneries, and other industries, which have largely failed to comply with the legislation, derided by Salma Ali of the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association as a dead law. Under the Qisas law of Pakistan, the perpetrator may suffer the same fate as the victim, and may be punished by having drops of acid placed in his/her eyes. This law is not binding and is rarely enforced according to a New York Times report. According to Afshin Molavi, in the early years of the revolution, and following the mandating of the covering of hair by women in Iran, some woman were threatened with an acid attack by the Islamic vigilantes for wearing a Hijab. Today, Iran has had several laws against acid attacks which is treated as a capital offense, and sentenced an attacker to be blinded in 2008. However, as of July 31, 2011, Ameneh Bahrami pardoned her attacker, thereby absolving Majid Movahedi of his crime and halting the retributive justice of Qisas.

Lower House of Parliament in Pakistan unanimously passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill On May 10, 2011. As punishment, according to the bill individuals held responsible for acid throwing face harsh fines and life in prison. Over the past few years, acid throwing has been recognized by many countries as one of the latest and most excruciating forms of violence committed against women.

STATISTICS
Acid violence remains under-reported but scores of women are victimized by this brutal act in South Asia every year.

The United Nations defines violence against women as any act of gender-based violence that results in physical, sexual or mental harm or suffering to women. Throwing acid on a woman is by far the cruelest form of abusing a person, leaving the individual paralyzed and psychologically unable to face society confidently again.

An acid attack is a deliberate act of throwing acid on a victim, mostly women, usually on the face that causes severe pain, permanent disfigurement, subsequent infections and often blindness in one or both eyes. The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are hydrochloric and sulfuric acid. The attacker commits acid attacks for a number of reasons, including revenge for refusal of a marriage proposal or other romantic or sexual advances land disputes perceived dishonor and jealousy. Valerie Khan, Director, Acid Survivors Foundation (ASF) says, 60 % of these attacks occur as the epitome of an already existing cycle of violence. While acid attacks are most prevalent in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India and Pakistan, they have also been widely reported in Afghanistan and in parts of Africa and Europe.

In Pakistan, approximately only 30% of acid cases are reported. Exact statistics on acid attacks in Pakistan are not available but roughly around 200 acid attacks take place in Pakistan every year at least 9000 acid attacks were reported between 1994 and 2011, according to data compiled by the Progressive Women's Association (PWA). A weak judicial system and lack of support from the police is partly to be blamed for the under reporting of such cases. Another major reason is that the victims families reach out of court settlements due to financial pressure, which prevents the compilation of any official statistics.

Acid attacks, a leading act of domestic violence, are common for a number of reasons. Acid is readily available not only in major cities but also in small towns across rural areas, costing less than Rs 100 a liter and is often used for household cleaning or for cotton processing in rural areas. Shopkeepers are unaware of any regulatory requirement concerning the sales and anyone can purchase an unlimited amount without question.

An important precaution, one that many are unaware of, is that the victims of acid burn should quickly douse themselves with water, for at least 30 minutes as it is important to neutralize the severity of the acid as quickly as possible. Given the limited medical care facilities available in Pakistan, this might be the victim's only chance to reduce the severity of the attack.

In other South Asian countries, the government has also taken a proactive approach to the crime. In 2002, Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for throwing acid and implemented laws strictly controlling the sales of acids. In 2011, Pakistan passed a law in the form of Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill that established tougher penalties for an acid-attack conviction -- 14 years to life behind bars and a fine of up to $11,000.

But womens rights activists are demanding greater regulation of the sale and distribution of acid to prevent these attacks. Better rehabilitation services are also crucial for victims so they can rebuild their lives. After an attack, the victim faces physical challenges, which require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which demand in-depth counseling from psychologists at each stage of physical recovery

Reports of acid burn cases are alarmingly on the rise but legislation to counter this remains wanting. Many hope that Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoys Oscar winning film, Saving Face, exploring acid-attacks, will bring the much needed pressure to transform the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill into action.

Every year, scores of Pakistani women are disfigured in acid attacks, usually at the hands of husbands or relatives. The attacks, often brought on by fits of jealousy or rage, go largely ignored and are rarely prosecuted. Only in the last decade, has the media increased coverage of such social issues.

The use of acid as a weapon has deep roots in Pakistani society. Short of murder, an acid attack is the most devastating form of aggression, transforming the victim into a figure of horror and an outcast. If this is not the time to do something about this atrocious act of violence, then one wonders if there ever will be a right time.

VICTIMS AND TREATMENT
Brutality of the damage depends on the concentration of the acid and the period of time before the acid is thoroughly washed off with water or neutralized with a neutralizing agent. The acid can rapidly eat away skin, the layer of fat beneath the skin, and in some cases even the underlying bone. Eyelids and lips may be completely destroyed, the nose and ears severely damaged. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in Pakistan, there is a high survival rate amongst victims of acid attacks. Consequently the victim is faced with physical challenges, which require long term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which require in-depth intervention from psychologists and counselors at each stage of physical recovery.

In Bangladesh, the Acid Survivors Foundation, Nairpokkho, Action Aid, and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committees Community Empowerment & Strengthening Local Institutions Programmed assist survivors in Bangladesh. The Acid Survivors Foundation in Pakistan operates in Islamabad offering medical, psychological and rehabilitation support. The Acid Survivors Foundation in Uganda operates in Kampala and also provides counseling and rehabilitation treatment to victims of acid attacks, as well as their families if need be. Additionally in Cambodia, LICADHO, the Association of the Blind in Cambodia and the Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity all assist survivors of acid attacks. The Acid Survivors Trust International provides specialist support to its sister organizations in Africa and Asia through its specialist team who work across the organizations transferring medical, psychological and social rehabilitation skills whilst supporting knowledge sharing and best practice.

CONCLUSIONS
An acid attack involves the premeditated throwing of acid on a victim, usually on her face. In addition to causing psychological trauma, acid attacks result in severe pain, permanent disfigurement, subsequent infections, and often blindness in one or both eyes. Perpetrators commit acid attacks for a number of reasons, including revenge for refusal of a marriage proposal or other romantic or sexual advances; land disputes; perceived dishonor; and jealousy. While acid attacks are most prevalent in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India and Pakistan, they have also been reported in Afghanistan and in parts of Africa and Europe. Experts attribute the prevalence of the practice in part to the easy availability of acids. ]]></string>

In general it is rain that Formed when gases, such as CO2 and SO2 react with the water in the atmosphere. It can kill micro-organisms, poisons plants, damages metals and limestone and kills fish.

Introduction:
Acid rain is a serious and dangerous problem because it is very harmful to the environment. It is a rain that has a very high concentration of acid-forming chemicals. These chemicals have been released into the atmosphere and joint with water vapor. Basically acid rain could damage everything over a short period of time and that is because it can makes living things die in the environment. For this reason I chose to write about the acid rain and chose Canada to be the study case.

Before we get through inside the study case, we should know a little information about this problem.

What is acid rain?
Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation like snow that is acidic. Acid rain is downpour containing harmful quantities of nitric and sulfuric acids which released into the atmosphere. When fossil fuels are burned, harmful emotions released into the air. The normal rain has almost pH of 5.6, which is faintly acidic. Unlike the normal rain that we all knew, acid rain has a pH below 5.6. It could consider as a result of air pollution. It has many other names such as acid precipitation or acid deposition. Emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are causing the acid rain, which they can react with the water molecules to produce acids. Acid rain could effects negatively on plants, aquatic animals, and infrastructure.

The effects of acid rain:
In the atmosphere acid rain can be carried very big and far distances between countries and from continent to another. It can take the form of snow, mists and dry dusts. Respiratory illnesses in animals and humans such as asthma can be caused by the dry dust. Wherever the rain falls, it can have a huge effect on soil, trees, buildings and water.

Effects of acid rain have on our health?
Acid rain affects human being in many different ways. One main way is our health. Acid rain could also effect on the air which can makes the acid rain pollution. Most of the breathing and lung problems in children and adults who have asthma were linked to acid air pollution.

There are many health problems that occur in the U.S. and Canada each year because of this problem. The following are health problems happen due to acid rain:

550 early deaths.

1,520 emergency room visits.

210,070 asthma symptom days.

What effect does acid rain to non-living things?
Just like the acid rain can damage living things, it also could harmful non-living things. For example it could damage the buildings and statues. It could failure building materials and paints. There are many types of materials. All these types will become eroded soon or later by the effects of the climate such as: water, wind, ice and snow which they can help in the erosion process. Unfortunately, acid rain can help to make this natural process faster.

What damage is acid rain doing in Canada?
The damage that caused by the acid rain in Canada is very huge. There are many damages such as: fourteen thousand lakes are now so acidic in this country which led to death for the plants, animals, fish and birds. In addition to that, trees in eastern Canada are dying because acid rain is slows down their growth and sometimes can make the bark splits until the tree dies. Another serious damage of the acid rain is that 84% of agricultural land in eastern Canada is polluted. Also it has been linked to respiratory diseases in children. Furthermore buildings are being affected in this country; especially the buildings that made of marble, granite and limestone. Some Statistics confirm that buildings in Canada are losing 4% of their weight every year.

Why is it doing such many damages in eastern Canada?
Actually the Largest amount of the acid rain that falls on Canada came from the USA. Moreover it is a big problem in eastern Canada because more of the water and soil systems in this region lack natural alkalinity. Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are the provinces that are part of the Canadian Precambrian Shield and that happened in these particular areas because their water and soil systems cannot fight the damaging consequences of acid rain.

What is being done to solve the issue?
Both of the USA and Canada governments are trying their best to solve this issue. There are several ways that they used to solve this problem. One of them was spraying trees with water to wash off the acid rain but unfortunately this way is not very effective. Nowadays in Canada they are replacing coal fired power stations with gas fired stations. Moreover they added lime to the lakes, rivers and soil. This way is very expensive and cost a lot of money, also it takes a very long time. Another way is fitted equipment in some power stations to remove emissions such as: sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This is an effective way but at the same time it is too expensive.

Conclusion:
To conclude, acid rain is very important issue that has bad effects in the environment. There would be many health problems that could be avoided, if acid rain became a little less of a problem. We can help to stop this acid rain by a very simple way which is not polluting the air. As they said Prevention is better than cure. Even children can help prevent this pollution by several ways like using less electricity and using transportation that is friendly to the environment.

    <string name="c6"><![CDATA[A journey is always enjoyable to me. If the journey is a journey by bus, it becomes more pleasant and thrilling. Recently I got a chance to make a journey by bus. I went to Laksham, Comilla from Dhaka.

On the 5th instant I made the journey. One of my friends villages home is in Laksham. He invited me to pay a visit to their home. Then I told it to my parents. They approved my proposal. Then I told my friend about my plan to visit his home.

On the appointed day, we met at Saidabad bus stand at 9 am. Then we bought two tickets of a luxurious bus. And we bought some snacks, water and newspaper. At 9:30 am we got into the bus and it began to move.

The bus started at a high speed. Soon it left the city and entered the countryside. The bus was running ahead leaving behind the trees, houses and small shops and green field.

We gossiped and took some snacks. I enjoyed the natural scenery at the both sides of the road. I saw the small hills with green trees on the top at Lalmai. I saw the BARD. I saw small cottages beside the road.

At 11:00 am we crossed the river Meghna through the Meghna Bridge. It is the most memorable thing of the journey. When our bus was on the bridge my heart leaped up with great joy. I saw many beautiful things on both sides of the river. Many fishing boats were floating on the river. I was fairly charmed with the beauty of the river.

At 1 pm we reached Laksham bus stand. Then we got down and hired a rickshaw to reach my friend's home.

The journey was really very interesting as well as instructive. It gave me much pleasure. I shall never forget the sweet memories of the journey.

    <string name="c17"><![CDATA[Air pollution means the ways in which the air is polluted. Air is the most important element of human environment. Man can not live a single moment without air. But we do not think that it is we who pollute this most vital element. Clean air is essential for life.

Air is polluted in many ways. For example smoke pollutes air. Man makes fires to cook his food, to make bricks burns refuse, melts pitch for road construction and burns wood. All these things produce heavy smoke and this smoke pollutes air.

The another example is that railway engines, power houses,mills and factories use coal and oil. Moreover, buses, trucks and cars use petrol and diesel oil. Again all these things create smoke and cause air pollution. Furthermore, the most serious air pollution also occurs in big cities where there are many mills and factories. Again serious air pollution also occurs in big cities where there are many buses, trucks and cars plying the street everyday.

Sometimes men in big industrial area become so sick by inhaling polluted air that they cannot be cured. So proper measures and steps should be taken to prevent air pollution.]]></string>

Pleasure multiplies when there is a wedding in the family. I drew immense pleasure when the marriage ceremony of my cousin was held. It was performed on 23rd of the last month.

We had not seen any marriage celebration in our family beforehand. My cousin was the first child to be married in the family. Her marriage was celebrated with great enthusiasm. Preparations for the marriage started one month before the celebration. My parents and my uncle and aunt spent a whole week making necessary purchases. The whole house was colour washed.

Football is one of the most popular games in the world. It is also one of the oldest games. It is a game of strength and stamina. In terms of popularity, it is as popular as cricket. Comparatively, it is more popular in Europe and Latin America.

Last Sunday, I got an opportunity to witness a football match which was played between Khalsa Modern School and Central School, Nawagaon. The match was played at the playgrounds of Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School, Navinagan, and Nawagaon. The entire ground was well decorated and a large number of chairs were arranged for the guests and spectators. Both the teams were well-prepared and confident of their win. The ground was full packed. The match was to start at 1 p.m. Both the teams entered the ground on scheduled time. After the toss, the referee blew the whistle and the match began. It was expected to be a well-contested and lively match. Both the teams were expecting to score well. During the first few minutes, it was the Khalsa Modern School who dominated the match. They struck hard to the defenses of their rival, but failed to score any goal. However, they performed brilliantly and the spectators enjoyed the game.


The captain was very tactful and confident. He was hopeful to turn the match in his favour. It was his confidence that instilled new hope and energy in the team. His team was again in high spirit. As a result it overturned the match and gained control over it which was lost during the mid-hour. In the meantime, the team scored a goal. The goal was appreciated with thunderous applause. The team was cheered by their supporters. Meanwhile, the right half of the Central School team was badly injured due to which the captain had to play the double role throughout the entire game. Within a few second the first half was declared to be over by the referee.

The match again started with the whistle of the referee. The team of Central School was equipped with strategies to defeat the Khalsa Modern School. But the players of Khalsa School were all the more alert particularly their goalkeeper was very tactful. The Khalsa Modern School made pressure on its rival during the first few minutes, by hitting one after another at the goal of the Central School but the goalkeeper of the rival team was extraordinarily sharp and quick in kicking the goal back. The game became very exciting and thrilling during the last minute.


At one time, the game appeared to be ended in draw. It caused a moral boosting to the losing team. There were loud cheers from their supporters. Each of the team was trying its best to win the match. The game was about to over but surprisingly the Central School scored a goal over Khalsa Modern School. This was a surprising win which caused a great sensation in the ground. There was deafening cheers from its supporters, but the fighting spirit of the opposite team was also being praised by all. Overall the match was enjoyed greatly by the spectators. ]]></string>

Cricket is one of the most popular games in the world. It is equally popular in the West as it is in India. Cricket players are worshipped like hero. We can see children playing cricket in villages and towns. Cricket is a highly lucrative game. It brings name, fame, wealth and money. Cricket players are showered with prizes and awards. Today, cricket offers a good career opportunity. Children have great fascination for cricket. It has become the number one game all over the world and has a bright future. A cricket match, especially, one-day match is a great show anywhere in the world. In India, many people take leave to enjoy the game of cricket particularly if it is being played between India and Pakistan. Thousands of persons feel overjoyed to see a cricket match either in stadium or on television screen. Big corporate giants sponsor a cricket match and give great prizes to the good performances.

Today, cricket has become a passion. Every young boy wants to become a Tendulkar. Tendulkar is the hero of the young generation. In fact, Tendulkar has become a brand name. The young generation devotes their lots of time and energy in trying to shape their career as a cricketer. Whenever a cricket match is held particularly India-Pakistan match, the whole atmosphere is changed. The whole nation wears a festive look. People can be seen discussing matches. There is firework with every shot and every catch. On such days people have nothing to discuss but cricket. When the Indian team wins, there is a great show of fireworks. It is enjoyed by bursting of crackers. People are overjoyed at the win of the Indian team. Governments offer handful gifts to the good performances.


Unfortunately, in recent years cricket has been defamed by “match-fixing”. It denigrated the prestige of many players and more importantly caused a decline in the popularity of cricket. People lost attraction for the game. But it is such a favourite game of the people that within no time it regained its lost popularity. Everything was back on the track.

Last winter, I along with one of my friends, went to see the final match of 20-20 between India and Pakistan at Eden Garden in Kolkata.

The stadium was packed to its capacity with cricket fans. The match started with the toss winning by Indian Cricket Team. Indian Team decided to bat first.


India got a good start with Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag giving it a strong position. But the team lost three wickets within only three over’s, which put Indian team into a difficult position. It once appeared that the match is going to end soon. But Irfan Pathan and Sreesanth did well to bring the team back to a good position. India ended the innings at 176.

The Pakistani team failed to give a good start. It lost its three wickets within ten over’s. But Shoaib Malik made a good score. Then the middle order batsmen performed well which helped Pakistan to gain a challenging position. But due to tactful fielding and bowling of the Indian team, the Pakistani team could not save the match and their innings ended at 162 with all the batsmen out and eight balls to spare.

Thus India won the trophy and Irfan Pathan was deservingly declared the ‘Man of the Match’.

There were celebrations all around. It appeared that it was the occasion of some festivals. I went back home with the hilling memories of the memorable match. ]]></string>
    <string name="c0"><![CDATA[ Introduction : A book fair is an attractive fair where different types of books are displayed. Nowadays it has become very popular. The two main book fairs held in our country are the Ekushey Boi Mela and the Dhaka Boi Mela. Other small scale book fair are also held in some other occasions including the Pahela Baishakh.

My visit to a book fair : I was very lucky to visit the Dhaka Boi Mela this year. When I entered the main gate of the fair, I found a different environment. It was clear to me that a book fair is a world in itself and it is different from other fairs.

My experience in the fair : I found that a huge number of books on varied interests are available in a book fair. I came to know from the authority  that the fair would last for a month. Men, women and children of all classes gathered in the fair. The stalls were occupied by different publishers. In the evening many poets, novelists and writers came to visit the fair. There was a crowd of people who were busy in selling and buying. Mainly the young boys and girls gathered in the fair to collect their liking books. From a book stall, I bought some of my favourite books.

Other attractions of the fair : It was my first experience of visiting a book fair. I thought that only books are sold in a book fair. But my conception changed when I visited the fair. Besides books, other articles like cassettes of songs and recitations, calendars, posters, painting pictures, snacks and tiny items of daily necessaries are also sold in a book fair. I. found that seminars and cultural programmes are also held in a book fair. I was very delighted to enjoy a staged drama based on the language movement of 1952.

Conclusion : After visiting the fair, I started for home in the late evening. The memory of the book fair is still kept in my mind.

A large number on relatives and my brothers personal friends had been invited to attend the party. At my grandmothers request, the party was held at our house. She is now rather too old to stand the strain of a long function held away from home. The house had been cleaned. Whitewashed, and suitably redecorated before the arrival of the auspicious day.

A little after 5p.m. the guests began to arrive. My brother and our parents were all ready to receive them. As they arrived, they were received at the front door of the house. All of them congratulate my brother and wished him many happy returns of the day. Most of the guests gave presents to my brother, though they had been specifically requested beforehand not to do so. This was, however not the occasion to return the presents that had been brought they were received most gratefully. The large table in our sitting-room was covered with pockets containing books, pens, articles of clothing and many other things.

My father had given my brother a new Rolex watch for his birthday present and my mother had bought him a new fountain pen. We his brothers, his sister and we had shown 0ur affection by putting together our months savings to buy him a pair of shoes. My grandmother gave him a handsome gift in cash.

At 6.p.m. sharp, all accept our parents and my brother had taken their seats in the hall, the gathering rose from their seats and sang a birthday song befitting the occasion.

When everybody was seated again, the dinner started. It consisted of a variety of delicious dishes especially prepared by my mother. Between the courses, there were speeches songs, and tit-bits. Thus the dinner continued up to 8 p.m.

At the end of the dinner, there were some games. These continued till all agreed that they were now quite ready for a few dances. A number of dances tunes had been recorded beforehand. These were now played back. We danced and danced till we were tired. At one stage, our parents also took the floor to, a long and loud applause from the spectators. My grandmother was, perhaps, the happiest of us all, as she watched while reclining on her easy chair.

Shortly before 11p.m. the dancing came to an end. Our parents and my brother bade goodbye to the guests and thanked them for their company. The guests in return, thanked them for the good time they had]]></string>

We saw two large cars approaching us from opposite directions. When the cars were within ten yards of each other both of them left their respective sides of the road and headed towards each other. There was a head-an-collision. The impact was so heavy that it attracted the attention of almost all people in the neighborhood. In a few minutes, there was a lager crowd surrounding the two cars, both of which had been overturned. Their engines had been completely wrecked and the drivers and the passengers in the front seats had been killed. Those sitting behind had been seriously hurt and shocked. Luckily, neither of the vehicles had caught fire.

I ran straight to the school, office and rang for the police and the ambulance. Meanwhile the members of Ehdi Ambulance Brigade from our school had reached the spot. With the help of some onlookers, they lifted the cars and helped the passengers still alive to get out. Most of them were unconscious and others were groaning with pain, They also gave them whatever medical aid they could.

A few minutes later, an ambulance and a police van arrived at the scene. The policemen took some measurements of the road. They took no statements as both the drivers had died and the survivors among the passengers were unconscious. The attendants and nurses in the ambulance, party had great difficulty in extracting the bodies of those dead inside the smashed cars. Many of the helpers could not bear' the sight of the grisly task they had to do some even fainted. While the dead bodies were being pulled out, the wounded passengers were removed to hospital for treatment.

The road where the accident had taken place presented a horrible sight. There were puddles of blood all over the place. Scattered here and there were pieces of flesh torn from the dead bodies.

The wrecked vehicles were removed to the traffic office. They are still lying there, as a grim reminder of What may happen when people get careless on the road.]]></string>
    <string name="c20"><![CDATA[The discovery of atomic energy is an event of great significance. It may be regarded as the completion of the industrial age. It will affect our lives for more than was done by the industrial Revolution. The great question, however, is of the use that may be made of this terrifying energy. It can be used both for good and evil. If used well it can make the world a happier place but if used wrongly it can wipe out the human race. Just as steam and electric power made big changes in our lives, both for good and evil, atomic power will mould our living far more deeply. In ten or fifteen years time atomic energy will be used in place of electricity. The fear is that these advances may not be accompanied by the right kind of thinking which can make wise use of them for the good of humanity.

Atomic ,energy can be used for power generation. In England it has been used for several years to heat houses in a small area. The United States of America has successfully employed atomic fuel in a submarine which can go to all the seas and remain under water without the need for refueling. 7 he Soviet Union has put into operation an atomic electric station of 5,000 Kwts. Within the next ten years or so many atomic power stations will be set up all over the world. Atomic energy has entered the farms, the factories, the power house, and the hospitals.

A significant application of atomic energy in the field of agriculture has been in the use of radioactive tracers in fertilizers. Radiation, when directed on seeds and plants, increases the crop output Experiments are going on to find a method of killing harmful bacteria by radiation. This will keep food lit for human use for longer than is possible new. It will be possible to produce food by laboratory process.

In the field of medicine it has already made great advances. In course of time it is going to revolutionize Medicine and give us the means to fight those diseases which are now considered beyond cure. Radioisotopes are used for medical operations. Radioactive cobalt can be employed to cure cancer,

In the field of industry its uses can be enormous. In the U. S. A. many firms are applying atomic energy to obtain better products at a lower cost Some countries have already started building electric plants which use atomic energy.

Another important field in which atomic energy will bring about revolutionary charges is communications..In a few years we can expect atomic energy to be used for, ocean going vessels, trains and air-craft. Isolated and barren lands will again become centers of activity; This new source of power can supply heat and light to villages hidden in far away valleys.

Industrialization has so far proceeded on the basis that most of the materials needed will be available. It is known that the reserves of a number of metals will not last for more than a few decades. The industrialization of new areas of the world will be checked if no other way is found. Atomic -energy has now given us new hope.

The source of the energy used in the world today is coal oil and gas, and hydro-electric power. The present known reserves of coal and oil are limited. In. wider developed countries they are no sufficient for attainment of a standard of living equal to that of industrially--advanced countries. Atomic energy here has a great role to play. It has been estimated that uranium and thorium contain enough atomic energy to meet the needs of the under-developed countries. Atomic energy will also enable the advanced countries to maintain a high standard of living for centuries to come.

The extent to which atomic energy is put to general use will depend upon capital and running costs involved and the very high quality of technical skill needed. At present atomic energy is extremely expensive. Its technology is very difficult. Development of new methods and techniques, along with greater education in atomic science will solve this problem.

While atomic energy has come as a great liberator of humanity, it has given to men vast power of destruction, it wise use is not made of the energy its ultimate dreadful consequences may outweigh the good it can do. We are living today under the shadow of nuclear weapons. The known consequences of the explosions of these are too horrible to think of though their full effects are not known, enough is known to show that such weapons endanger the very existence of the human race If another World War breaks out millions will be killed. Many millions injured and many more millions will die a slow and painful death. All over the world there have been protests against the tests of such weapons. There is also a move to get these weapons banned. Nobody knows for certain if the leaders of the two Great Powers will realize this danger to mankind and take a pledge not to use atomic power for destructive purposes.

A part from the heat and blast effects of such weapons, man like Einstein and Bertrand Russell have warned against the radiological effects of nuclear explosions. A number of radio-active substances, such as radio-strontium, enter into the body, soil, air, water and food. This brings about various diseases, life shortening and giving show death. Not only the present but the future generations are also subject to the dreadful effects.

The future of atomic energy is full of hope and danger.]]></string>

One evening at about 8 p.m., just as Sams uncle was about to close for the day, two men on a motorcycle stopped outside. They got off and walked into the shop. Sam thought that it was odd that they should be wearing dark glasses at night. Anyway who was he to question what another should wear?

Sam was about to ask the men what they wanted when both of them drew pistols from their pockets. One pointed a pistol at Sam and the other at Sams uncle. Sam froze and stared at the pistol pointed at him. He could not believe his eyes. These two were robbers wearing dark glasses to conceal their identities!

The next moment Sam and his uncle were made to lie face-down on the floor. Sam heard the cash register ring and the drawer open. Then he heard a shuffling of feet, the roar of a motorcycle starting up and suddenly all was quiet.

Sam looked up. The robbers were gone. Sam shook his uncle who was still prostrate on the floor. They got up. Sam's uncle ran to the cash register. The robbers had taken every cent from it. The robbery had happened so quickly. It took less than a minute for the robbers to come and vanish with the day's takings.

Sams uncle shook his head. At least the robbers did not harm them. The only thing left to do was to inform the police and let them handle the case. As for Sam, he learned to be wary of strangers who wore dark glasses at night.]]></string>

Just about 6,000 years ago, men lived in a cave. He dressed himself in skins. He fed himself by hunting and fishing. He had to make with his own hands everything he needed: He went long distances on his own legs. His world was narrow, dark, difficult and dangerous. Modern man lives a vastly different life. He is comfortably and elegantly housed, fed and clothed. His world is broad, bright, easy and reasonably safe. Old-time physical exertion is no longer necessary for him.

It is science that has brought about this "brave new world". This life of leisure and pleasure. In so far as science has done this, it is blessing. Let us first look at the bright side of the medal.

Science has made wonderful machines. It has discovered marvelous energies which run these machines. Man need no longer toil and moil with his hands and legs. The machine does most of his work for him. It gives him leisure. The dream of a push-button existence has come true for him.

Distance has been annihilated. Modern transport and communication have made the world shrink almost to nothing. Men and things and news and views can girdle the globe with lightning speed. Inter-planetary travel is now a certainty. We are now on the eve of colonizing new planets.

Our lives have become healthier. Modern hygiene, sanitation, medicine and surgery are conquering more and more physical and mental ills day by day. No disease is beyond cure now. The longevity of life has increased. The quinine has finished malaria and glucose injections put a new life in a dying man. Surgery has created wonders.

Science also provides entertainments to millions of people. Cinema entertains us and radio and television provides recreation. The production of food has increased. Industry has been revolutionized. Starvation has been controlled. In short, the scientific progress is amazing.

It is an established fact that science has made valuable contribution to the development of human intellect. Material civilization has also made a wonderful stride. But the moral development of man or moral values has been totally neglected. Science has provided us with a huge stock of knowledge but unfortunately it is not being put to right use. As result of this, we have miserably failed to achieve the desired object. We have more knowledge and skill but less of character and self-control. Scientific development has out stripped our moral or spiritual progress. It has made us selfish, greedy and cruel. The machine has made us materialistic. The existing condition without a balance will make our lives miserable with a horrible future. So, Lord Tennyson laments that knowledge has come but wisdom lingers.]]></string>
    <string name="c27"><![CDATA[“Our sweetest songs are those that tell our saddest thoughts”. Childhood is the most innocent phase and also the sweetest period of mans life. They cheer our heart and make us forget sorrow. So, I often look back to my childhood days and try to gather joy from their happy recollections. I remember many things that give me joy even today and many others that fill my mind with pain. Yet the sweet memories of childhood linger on. My childhood recollections are those of a sheltered and carefree life, nurtured with love and concern. As I was the first child in the family, everybody doted on me.

My funny lisping, my innocent mischief and my inane talk-everything was a source of immense pleasure to them. There was never a word of reproach or censure against me. My first recollection of my childhood is the day I fall down the stairs when I was three years old. I was so upset that I cried and cried for nearly an hour in spite of my parents attempts at comforting me. Finally, I calmed down when I was given ice-cream and chocolates. Luckily, I was not hurt.

I remember the day clearly when I first went to school. It was a new life to me, but I liked it very much. I made friends with many boys there. I went to school with them and I enjoyed these very much. My teachers loved me very much. I was never afraid of them and they never beat me. I did my lessons well every day. I was fond of story-books. I read the stories of the Quran and the Hadith. They left a deep impression on me. Sometimes tears stood in my eyes when I read about the sufferings of freedom fighters.

When I was ten years old, I had gone with some boys to a neighboring village on pool. I did not inform my parents. We could not return till it was very dark. My parents were very anxious. They searched for me everywhere, but I could not be found. At last, when they saw me coming back late at night, my father jumped at me. He held me firmly by my arm. When he was about to beat me, my mother came forward to save me. I was left off with a strong scolding. A father, though loving is often strict, but a mother is always tender to her children. My mother always saved me from the anger of my father. Thus I liked my mother more than I liked my father.

I still remember those days when I was learning to ride a bicycle. I fell and bruised myself several times but I never gave up. Finally, I was able to join my friends going around the neighborhood on my bike.

When I was young I did not like my school teacher because sometimes he used to beat me. It is good that the system of beating is abolished now. We had to go to school early in the morning. In the beginning, like most boys, I was unwilling to get up early in the morning and go to school. But as I was interested in my studies I enjoyed going to school.

The village market was also a place of great interest for me. It used to sit twice a week in the heart of the village. I used to go there with my father on market days and enjoyed much. To my great joy, my father would often buy me sweets and toys.

The memory of my stealing fruits is very interesting. I was very fond of stealing mangoes, litchis, black barriers and other fruits with my friends. One day I and some of my friends went to steal mango in a certain tree. But the owner of the tree caught us with mangoes. We were trembling with fear. But the man did nothing. I shall never forget this memory.

My days of childhood were really spent in happiness. Really, it would be very interesting if I got back those days again. There was only the sad incident of my grandmother's death. I had no cares and anxieties. I thought of eating, reading, playing and wearing gay clothes and beautiful shoes and nothing else. Now I am a grown-up lad. I cannot now pass days as care-free as I did in the past.

    <string name="c28"><![CDATA[Bangladesh is punished by cyclones almost every year. The reason in its geographical location on the Bay of Bengal. So the depressions formed on the bay travel upward and hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh.

First the depression is formed on the sea. The sun shines hotly on the sea. The air of a particular area lightens up. The colder wind from the surrounding area rushes to occupy this vacant space. The low pressure is formed. The depression gathers force and spirits forward towards northeast. The wind blows strongly. Thunder and lightning accompany the gales. The waves of the sea become unruly. The cyclone is formed land it hits the land maliciously.

A severe cyclone blew Chittagong and adjacent areas on April 29, 1991. It was the strongest storm, we have ever witnessed. There was intolerable heat for a few days. The sky was overcast and gloomy. The trees looked contemplative. It was a Monday. By 9 o’clock at night gusty winds began to blow. Thundering sounds started booming. The big trees shook violently and they looked so supple. By twelve midnight the cyclone began to rage demonically. It continued like that for four hours. Only by 9 the following morning the cyclone completely subsided.

The aftermath of cyclone 91 was massive. Trees and houses were blown away like peanut shells. Many boats were blown inside the land at Chi8ttagong. The loss of cattle and the damage to property were huge. Almost 5,00,000 people were killed.

the cyclone shelters should be erected on the coastal area. The cyclone signalling system also should be modernized.

Cancer is one of the most important non-infectious or non-communicable diseases.

“Cancer is referred to as an ailment characterised by an unrestrained growth of abnormal cells which if untreated and unchecked eventually kills the patient.”

In India nearly four lakhs of people are affected by cancer every year. Out of them two lakhs of people die. It is mainly due to late detection. Many people are not aware of the early symptoms of this disease.

What is Cancer?

The growth of multicellular animals occurs due to addition of new cells. The old or existing cells divide by mitosis to form new cells. This division is controlled and regulated by some factors. Sometimes, due to unknown reasons, some cells divide in abnormally faster rate to form a lump.

This lump increases rapidly causing ulcers. It causes serious complications in the body. These abnormal cells first destroy the organ and then the whole body. These cells utilize the total food of the body. So the affected person becomes weak, looses his weight and ultimately dies. The tumors, enclosed in connective tissue are called benign tumor and when the tumors grow, it is called as malignant.

Types of Cancer:
Cancer can be divided into different types:

1. Sarcoma:
The cancer which occurs in muscles, cartilages, bones, blood vessels, connective tissues are known as sarcoma.

2. Carcinoma:

This type of cancer originates from skin or cells which lines the internal organs.

3. Lymphoma:

It is the cancer of lymph glands and lymph nodes.

4. Leukemia:

It occurs in blood forming organs, specially the bone marrow. It is found that no organ of body and no species is free from cancer.

Causes of Cancer:
The real cause of cancer is not yet known.

The following aspects can be attributed to the cause of cancer:
1. Excessive smoking has been found to be associated with lung cancer, cancer in urinary bladder, mouth, throat, larynx etc.

2. Chewing of tobacco, betel nuts etc. are believed to be the cause of cancer in mouth, throat, oesophagus etc.

3. A large number of dyes, chemicals, heavy metals can cause cancer.

4. Ionic radiations like X-ray, gamma ray etc. can cause cancer.

5. Alcohol is thought to be the cause of cancer in stomach, liver, gall bladder etc.

6. Pollutants like chemicals, smoke, dust may be responsible for cancer. Though the exact cause of cancer is not known, the above described substances are mutagens which can cause mutation in genes. The mutant genes have no control over normal functioning of the cell. So it may lead to cancer.

Sites of Cancer:
Though cancer can develop at any part or organ of the body, it mostly develops in some organs like liver, alimentary canal, larynx, pharynx, tongue, lips, gall bladder, lungs, uterus, urinary bladder, lymph nodes, bones etc.

Primary Symptoms of Cancer:
1. Presence of any persistent lump or thickening of tissues in lip, tongue or breast.

2. Any wound that does not heal.

3. Unusual bleeding or discharge of blood.

4. Persistent indigestion, difficulty in swallowing.

5. A regular change in bowel movements.

6. Rapid change in rate of growth, colour and form of mole or wart.

7. Change in the voice.

8. Unusual loss of weight of the body.

How Cancer Spread?
Cancer spreads inside the body rapidly and infects other organs, called metastasis:

(i) Cancer cells grow through the walls of blood vessels.

(ii) Cancer cells are carried by the blood stream to other parts of the body.

(iii) Cancer cells pass through lymphatic vessels and lymph glands.

(iv) Cancer cells spread from tissues to tissues.

Behaviour of Cancerous Cells:
Normal cells of the body have a control over the division. The controlling factor is present in the DNA. The DNA directs the cells to divide and stops the division when not required. In cancerous cells the controlling factor is not present, probably due to mutant genes. Due to absence of controlling factor, the mitosis continues uncontrolled and forms cancer. It is believed that these cells carry certain cancer causing genes, called oncogens. These oncogenes remain inactive. Certain conditions initiate these genes to multiply and destroy the normal controlling factor of the cells.

Suspected Involvement of Virus in Cancer:
The role of virus is strongly suspected now. Some retrovirus, which causes tumor may be involved in this process. It is known that these viruses have RNA as genetic material. These RNA have the capacity to integrate with the host DNA. By the process of “reverse transcriptase”, these RNA make copy of the DNA.

This DNA acts as viral oncogene. The viral oncogenes may interact with the oncogenes of the cell, called proto-oncogenes and take control of the cell function. The DNA, which have been transcribed from viral RNA, transcribe back the viral RNA through normal transcription processes forming large number of new retroviruses.

Treatment of Cancer:
Cancer is curable, if it is detected at the early stages. The patient enjoys full life without recurrence of the disease.

Cancer is treated in three ways:

(i) Surgery:

Some of the infected organs are removed from the body by surgery: Example-Uterus, breast etc.

(ii) Radiotherapy:

The affected organs are irradiated to kill the cancerous cells and prevent them from spreading.

(iii) Chemotherapy:
Strong chemicals are used to kill the cancerous cells and isolate these cells from other organs. Sometimes all these three methods are applied to cure cancer. This dreaded disease can be cured fully, if it is detected at the preliminary stage. So social consciousness should be developed for early detection.

Oncogenes:
Oncogenes (Gk. Onkos meaning cancer) were initially identified as genes carried by viruses that cause transformation of their target cells. A major class of Oncogenes, the oncogenes present in acute transforming retroviruses, has homologues in animal genomes; these cellular counterparts are called Proto- oncogenes.

Proto-Oncogenes:
Proto-oncogenes participate in normal cell function, and in certain cases, a mutation or aberrant activation of a Proto- oncogenes causes tumour formation. So far trans membrane proteins to transcription factors.

Viral Oncogenes:
Transformation represents a gain-of-function in which a Proto- oncogene is activated either because of its acquisition by a retrovirus (this generates a viral oncogene or v-onc) or its activation by mutation or by association with new regulatory sequences due to recombination, leading to its expression where it is usually not expressed or an over expression in the tissue of its usual expression (this generate cellular oncogenes or (c-onc). Oncogenic development results from either increased expression of the oncogene or an alteration in the activity of the oncoprotein. Oncogene in such cases therefore is dominant over its Proto- oncogene counterpart.

Tumour Supressor Genes:
There are a group of genes whose inactivation (loss-of -function) by mutation, including deletion leads to tumour formation; these are known as Tumour Suppressor Genes. These genes usually impose some restriction on the cell cycle or cell growth.

Therefore a loss-of- function for such genes is tumorigenic. In such cases, tumour development is recessive to normal development, and both the alleles must be inactivated by mutation or deletion to allow oncogenesis. ]]></string>

How invented: Computer was not invented over a night.First of all Pascal invented the theory of “Digital Calculating System” in 1942.Though his attempts were not crowned with Mr. Haward Akin, an american scientist invented such a machine in 1937 that can do difficult sums.So the credits for the invention of modern computer goes to Howard Akin.After seven years electric computer was used in Harvard University in 1944.After that many other computers have been invented such as EDSAC in 1945 and ENTANCE in 1946 etc.

Major components of a computer: A computer consists of five components.They are the input unit, the output unit ,the control unit, the memory unit , the arithmatic unit.

Function of a computer: A computer performs three functions :
1) it receives data,
2) it processes data by various computations,
3) it emits data



Machine language: Every computer has a machine language of its own and accordingly a computer functions. Machine language is not fixed.Its varies from machine to machine. Programmes written in machine language and they are only good for particular machine.

Uses of computer: Computer is a great use to us.it renders a great service to man kind.it is like ALADIN’S magic lamp or magic wand.It has lessened our work loads and made our life easy and comfortable.It is used our daily life for various purposes.

In education: computer is media of education in the developed countries.The students of developed countries use computer to prepare their study meterials.They learn many things within shortest possible time.Results of various examinations are prepared accurately with the help of computer within the shortest span of time.

In medical science: Now a days in developed countries computer is used to diagnose a disease.A newer process of operation has been invented by computer.It is used to grind stones in normal pathological tests.

In agriculture: Today computer is used in the field of agriculture in the developed countries . A farmer of USA simply puts on the switch of computer and gets everything done.

Source of income: Computer is a source of great income . Many developed and advanced countries export software and hardware and earn a lot.

Demerits: There Is no unmixed blessings on earth. Everything has its dark sites. Computer has its own Demerits too. It causes diseases like respective stress injury and weakens the eye sight of the operators.

Computer in Bangladesh: Of late computer has been computer introduced in Bangladesh. Many Government and none govt. offices are using computer.A course on computer has been introduced in secondary levels.The day is not far to come when computer s will be used in every sphere of life.

Conclusion: Computer is of great use to us . We can not go a single day without computers. It is a part and parcel in our daily life.

Alternative Computer Essay:
Introduction: With the latest invention of modern science , our civilization is getting more development. The computer has been a great wonder of modern science. There is no denying the fact that the role of the computer in this modern age is inevitable. The inventor of the computer said, “no doubt, computer is an intrinsic congenial to the human exposure. “

What computer is: A computer is a collection of device that helps people perform mathematical calculations. It is regarded as a special kind of electronic machine that can perform mathematical calculations and process large amount of data as a great speed. In a few minutes , a computer can perform calculation that a trained mathematician would need years to do. Though a computer can perform many complex jobs at a tremendous speed, it had no capacity to do anything by itself . It works on the basis of commands given by the operator.

A substitute for human brain: We live in a age of science. Science plays the most vital role in modern civilization. Now it has raised human civilization up to the highest peak. So long, we are enjoying the benefits of cinema, radio, television, telegraph, telephone, X-ray and so on. But now we are enjoying the benefit of another wonderful invention of science. It is computer which has come forward to work as a substitute for human brain.

Invention of computer: A British professor of mathematics named Charles Babes deserved the credit for the invention of computer. He wrote about a formula which would human brain. According to his formula, he made a machine. As electronic parts did not come into use at that time, he used metallic parts. As a result, the machine did not function properly. Following the formula of Charles Babes, an American scientist named Howard Akin invented an improved computer. It could do difficult sums. But the most modern computer made with electronic parts does wonderful things. The history of the invention of computer is a chronicle of continuous assessment.

Kinds of computer: Computers are of three kinds – the Analogue, the Digital and the Hybrid. An Analogue Computer can solve the difficult problems of mathematics within a very short time . A digital Computer can do varieties of things . It not only keeps accounts but also finds out defects of other machines and it tells about its solution. Nowadays, a computer means a digital computer . And a hybrid computer works with the help of Digital and Analogue computer. It is also called a mixed computer.

The parts of computer : A computer has mainly three parts-
1. Central Processing Unit
2. Input devices like keyboard, mouse, joysticks, floppy disks, etc
3. Output device include printer, monitor, etc.

The Central Processing Unit is the brain of computer . The input part receives signals and the output part gives the result.

How it works: In a computer , the questions arranged though some signals and sent to the machine. This signaling is called a programme . Different programming languages are used in different computers . Programming plays a very important role in modernizing our thinking and thoughts . At first , the questions are sent to the receiver machine. The receiver machine then sends them to the preservation machine. Thousands of words and numbers are arranged in the preservation machine. They are the brain or memory of computer. The central machine carries out the directions of the preservation machine and finds out the solution. Finally, the result comes out of the output part of computer.

Uses of computer: Computer can be used in various sections. Really speaking, computer has a great influence on our everyday life. It has lessened our workloads and made our life easy and comfortable.

However, we are now using computers in the following fields :

In education: Computer plays an important role in the field of education. Many developed countries’ students use computer to prepare their study materials. They collect various information regarding their study though internet with the help of computer. In educational institution, most of the records are stored in computer.

In commerce: At present , business, commerce and trade cannot be thought of without the help of computer. In the business field, computer is used to prepare documents, to make lists of goods, store information and to prepare budget etc. In modern business , most of the communication is done though internet by computer .
In printing : The influence of computer in the field of printing is very great. Really speaking, printing and publication cannot be thought without computer.

In medical science: At present in many developed countries , computer is used to diagnose diseases . A newer process of operation has been invented by computer as an alternative to surgery.

Disadvantages: There are many disadvantages of computer .It sometimes submits embarrassing data and information directed by an evil brain . Sometimes, it used to degrade the prestige of a dignified person . The disadvantages don’t lie with computers ,but to human beings. It must be resisted.

Conclusion: Finally, it can be stated that computer is the greatest contribution of science . It will make the unemployment problem acute. In spite of this , we must welcome it. Regarding its beneficial contribution Howard Akin says, “computer invented not to create problems but to solve them has been treated as the dream machine  ]]></string>

Mobile phones can connect to the Internet via a data card which converts computer data into a form that can be passed over the network and vice versa.

Mobile phones have revolutionized the Societies of the world. Every single person is now taking interest in keeping a mobile phone. Mobile phones prove a good invention of science because they can receive and send signals to communicate. The hand sets are so small that they can be easily kept in pocket. Everyone who has a mobile phone set and connection can be detected easily and his relatives and friends and other persons who want to talk to him on important matter can easily call him on his personal mobile phone. Thus mobile phones make the world more closely.

Every technology has its pleasant effects as well as bad effects, similarly where mobile phones are the source of many advantages, they also provide a trend of fashion. People want to keep the mobile phone of latest technology, they spend a lot of money on buying mobile phone without considering on their budget of income and expenditure. The students are looking everywhere playing with their mobile phones. Some immoral activities are also being shown by the use of the mobile phones. The rate of crimes has also been increased due to the increasing use of mobile phones. Hence we can say mobile phone is necessity, if it is used in constructive process but if it is used only as fashion, it becomes a great source of the wastage of our precious time.]]></string>

So discipline is a moral quality. Discipline means obedience to law and order. It is necessary to obey the rules of discipline because human progress depends on it.

Men live in a society. He cannot do whatever he likes. So he has to obey some rules and regulations. If everybody violates the rules of discipline, the society will get chaotic. So discipline has a great value in every sphere of our life. It is essential for happiness and progress.

Discipline may be classified into three types. They are personal discipline, public discipline, and religious discipline. Personal discipline is formulated by the person himself. Public discipline is imposed by the state and law. And religious discipline is regulated by the religion one follows.

Everyone in the army is to lead a strictly disciplined life. If the soldier does not obey orders or if the General does not obey instructions, the army becomes at once a mere rabble. Difficulties or dangers cannot divert a soldier from carrying out the orders of his commanders.

Discipline is strictly maintained in games and sports. A player has to obey the decisions of the referee or umpire and the captain of the team. A disciplined team always wins over an undisciplined team.

In every house there is a sort of government. All the members obey and respect the head of the family. And the head leads the family in a disciplined way. A disciplined family leads a healthier and happier life.

A student has to obey the rules of the institute. He has to carry out the order or advice of his superiors, show respect to his teachers. The teachers and the staff also obey the rules of the institute.

An office cannot run smoothly if the juniors do not obey the orders of the seniors. Discipline is essential for the growth and development of all the social, political or economic organizations. The society and the state depend upon the disciplined conduct of their members. Discipline is found even in the society of the lower animals.

Discipline has a great importance at every sphere of life. It ensures safety, peace, progress and happiness to all.

The achievements of our civilization are the rewards of discipline. Discipline makes a man real and pure one. Thus nothing can go on smoothly without discipline. There can be no progress and no stability of a society or a state without discipline.

Life in modern time has become complicated. So the necessities of discipline have become greater now. Again life without discipline means a life full of chaos. So we should lead our lives in a disciplined manner. ]]></string>
    <string name="c33"><![CDATA[Introduction: "Digital Bangladesh" means an ICT based modern country where there will be adequate power supply, well-networked infrastructure, use of internet, use of open-source software, e-banking, e-commerce and e-governance. Of late the phrase "Digital Bangladesh" has been much talked about especially during the election campaign of the political parties targeting the ninth parliamentary election.

Meaning of Digital Bangladesh: To cherish such a dream is easy, but it is too much difficult to materialize this dream. Land phone, mobile, computer, laptop, e-magazine and diary, e-book reader and many more tools of information technology will be available in every nook and corner of the country. People will no more have to stand in queue to collect tickets, results etc. or to deposit and withdraw money or to buy and sell things. Broadly speaking, a digital society ensures an ICT driven knowledge-based society where information will be readily available online and where all possible tasks of the government, semi-government and also private spheres will be processed using the modern technology. So, "Digital Bangladesh" must guarantee efficient and effective use of modem ICT in all spheres of the society with a view to establishing good governance.

Why Digital Bangladesh: Due to globalization, Bangladesh has already been connected with the outside world. Yet In the field of ICT, our only grand success lies in Mobile telecommunication which has brought an abrupt change in telecommunication scenario of the country. However, in the other spheres of ICT, our achievement is very insignificant and we are still far away from transforming ourselves into a knowledge-based society. Building strong ICT infrastructure is the pre-requisite for making Bangladesh a digital one. For this, we need to focus on the following relevant issues:

(a) Power deficit: Latest statistics reveal that Bangladesh faces a power deficit of up to 2000 MW against a demand of 5000 MW daily. It may be noted that for proper ICT development an uninterrupted power supply is a must.

(b) Network infrastructure: Outside Dhaka, at present a few computer network infrastructures have been developed so far. Apart from some educational institutes outside Dhaka, observation finds that most of the LAN setups are Dhaka centric. This observation reveals the reality of the digital gap even within the country.

(c) Use of internet: For the ICT development internet users of the country must be increased. In this case our position is the worst one among the South Asian countries. Latest statistics (2007) revealed that internet penetration in our country is only 0.3 whereas in Pakistan and India it is 7.3% and 5.3% respectively.

(d) Use of open source software: Many countries (e.g. France and Malaysia) have started to use open source software in ICT development projects for cost effectiveness. Unfortunately in our ICT development domain, the culture of using open source has not yet been introduced.

(e) English-literacy rate: From different sources, it has been learnt that, English literacy rate in Bangladesh is less than one percent. In the arena of ICT English has become lingua-Franca. Unfortunately, in this case our position is the worst in the sub-continent. For making a digital Bangladesh by 2021, the government must address the above issues effectively and efficiently in transparent manners. Moreover, the journey towards a digital country needs the incorporation of the technologically solvent innovative young generation. If the leaders of our country objectively guide this generation, they can change the nation radically.

(f) Better agricultural production: The farmers will use all types of modern motorized tools instead of traditional equipment and their hand-driven tools to cultivate their lands. They will have to get ample online help about producing more and more crops.

(g) Modern treatment: Patients will have to get telemedicine and tele-surgery facilities with the use of audio and video conferencing based net. Besides, 24-hour online help will radically change the traditional medical services.

(h) E-learning and e-commerce: All the educational and commercial institutions will come under a good network system and the details of these institutions and their activities will be available on websites. E-paper, digitized pen, e-book, pen drive and screen-touch tools will replace the traditional tools for many different reasons.

How to materialize the vision: The government is very firm to ensure 100% net students enrolment at primary level within 2021. Supply of pure drinking water for the entire population will be ensured within 2011. Bangladesh will gain self-sufficiency in food within 2012. Each and every house of Bangladesh will be brought under hygienic sanitation in 2013. Moreover, within this same year Bangladesh will generate 7000 megawatt of electricity which will be further increased to 8000 megawatt in 2015. And in 2021, 20000 megawatt of electricity will be generated. In 2013, degree level education will be made tuition-free especially for women. Unemployment rate will be reduced to l5% from 40% at present. Labor in agriculture will come down to 30% from 48% at present. Labor in industry will be increased to 25% from 16% at present; in service 45% from 36% at present. Poverty rate will be reduced to 15% from 45% at present. Bangladesh will be known as a country of educated people with skills in information technology. 85% of the population will have standard nutritional food. The poorer section of the people will have at least 2122 calories of food. All types of contagious diseases will be eliminated; longevity of life expectancy will increase up to 70 years. Infant mortality will come down to 15 from 54 per thousand at present. Maternal death rate will come down to 1.5% from 3.8%. Use of birth control methods will be increased to 80%.

Conclusion: Time has come for Bangladesh to develop her information technology and to turn her "Digital Bangladesh". We need to bear in mind that to be away from enriched information technology means to live like a frog living in a well. We should look at the advanced countries of the world so that we can get modern ways and strategies from them to bring about a revolution for our ICT based society. Like Mahathir Muhammads Malaysia, we have to have our all-out efforts to materialize our desired Vision-2021 for our betterment and own existence.]]></string>

Some of the domestic animals are of great use to us. They are the cow, the buffalo, the goat and the sheep. They are wealth to the owner. People take fancy for the horse, the dog and the cat. So they tame them, now we shall discuss some of them.

Cow: Of all the domestic animals the cow is the mode useful to us. It gives us milk. Many things of food are made of milk. Its dung is good manure. Bags, shoes and other useful things are made of its hide. We get buttons and combs from its bones and horns. The bull draws cart and ploughs the fields.

Buffalo: The buffalo is a four footed domestic animal. It is found everywhere in Bangladesh. It is gentle by nature but looks ugly. It lives on grass and draws the carts and ploughs.

Horse: The horse is a four-footed domestic animal. Its body is covered with soft glossy hair. There are many kinds of horses. They are of different colours and sizes. The horse can run fast. It is intelligent and faithful to his master. It lives on grass, hay, straw and gram. It draws the ploughs and carries heavy loads. Its hide, hoofs mane is useful to us.

Goat: The goat is mild gentle. It is found all over the Bangladesh. It gives us flesh and milk. It gives us two or three calf at a time. The goat is very useful to us.

Dog: The dog is a good servant of man. It watches over its master’s house at night. The dog lives on flesh, rice and bread. Mad dogs are very dangerous; a good dog is a good companion.

Cat: The cat is gentle by nature. It kills tats and saves us from their harms.

Sheep: The sheep is like goats. It is also very useful to us. It gives us calm hide. Many useful things are made of its hide.

Thus domestic animals are more or less useful to us. We should be kind to them.]]>

    <string name="c30"><![CDATA[Labour is full of dignity. We are destined to undergo labour. Allah has given us hands to work with. We should use them as long as we are strong and able. So it is our dignity to do our work with own hands. We should not sit idle and try to have over work done by others.

It is a matter of dishonour to depend on others so man must earn his bread by sweat of his brow. For greater progress and more comfort man has to labour harder and harder. It is due to man’s hard labour that beautiful cities have grown up even in forest. Man has controlled rivers and made use of water flow by hard labour. He has been able to turn the barren deserts into fertile corn fields. So labour is at the roof of all human progress.

Nothing can be done or gained without labour. We cannot fulfil our purpose if we do not work hard. We cannot get even idle bare necessaries of life if we are averse to labour. The value of labour has been accepted by all at all times in all countries. Labour is said to be worship. It is sacred and full of honour. There is nothing of dishonour to do one’s work with one’s own hand.

Labour is sacred, because it keeps us alive. If a person does not labour, he must suffer in the long run. If the farmers refuse to plough land, they not only go without food but also make the entire nation starve. If the workers of mills and factories refuse to work, the whole nation is to be deprived of manufactured goods. So labour occupies an important role in human life.

Labour fills a person with a sense of dignity and independence. It gives him the true spirit of courage and self-conscience. He does not receive charity and earn his own labour. It is not a disgrace to be a shoe-maker but it is certainly a great dishonour to be a bagger.]]>

A wonderful gift of science: it is a wonderful gift of science. With the help of dish antenna we can communicate with the whole world. Dish antenna is a great glorification of the modern civilization. Dish antenna and the whole world: Dish antenna has united the separated countries of the world. We can see and hear every important matters of the world staying in our country through television, with the help of dish antenna. So it has united the whole world.

The importance of dish antenna: The importance is noted bellow:
(a) Dish antenna shortens the world.
(b) Dish antenna broadens world’s co-operation and communication.
(c) It is a great medium of getting commercial articles.
(d) It has a role in the world’s economy.
(e) It refines our culture and education etc.

Bad effects of dish antenna: The bad effect of dish antenna is noted bellow:
(a) Dish antenna leads the people of the world towards the ultra-modern and teddy life.
(b) It is destroying culture and religion.
(c) Dish antenna trough television shows naked and vulgar sights and sounds.
(d) It influences our youngsters to the moral degradation.
(e) It exaggerates the commercial articles for selling and buying.

Dish antenna and Bangladesh: Bangladesh became victim to the vulgarism of foreign countries. Bangladesh is a poor country. But she has imported many dish antennas recently. It is a great menace to the total peace and harmony of Bangladesh. Our people don’t take dish antenna as a didactic basis. It may not appropriate to our country.

Educative value of dish antenna: The aerial help of television assist television to display the whole world’s program. It is fit for open education. It is also an instrument of national program.

Commercial value of it: Bad articles are shown in the screen of T.V as good articles with the help of dish antenna. As a result the customers are cheated. So, the bad articles are getting priority. But we get news of new prepared articles through television.

Television can display only one country’s program. But with the help of dish antenna we can see and hear the program of the whole world. A great Islamic thinker Rd. Shamshed Ali says, “Dish antenna has many good effects but it has also many bad effects. It fully depends on our adoption and adjustment.]]>

In some special cases certain restricted drugs are used to cause sleep or relieve pain in a very limited and measured way. Higher or repeated does of the drugs excite a man beyond self-control. Now-a-days some derailed or frustrated people are addicted to these drugs. The addiction to these dangerous things has created many personal and national problems.

Heroin, cocaine and morphine are restricted drugs. Heroin is a very costly drug. It is very dangerous too. Wine, opium and hemp are forbidden intoxicants. All restrictions and prohibitions have failed to prevent many of our young persons from taking these dangerous things.

The causes of drug addiction are many. Frustration is said to be the main cause of addiction. Defeat in the struggle of life, unemployment problem, lack of love and affection in the family and accidental loss of property and money create frustration among our young people. This habit is formed through bad company. Easy availability of drugs is another cause.

A drug addicted person does many bad and unsocial works. The drugs harm the brain cells, stomach, liver and pancreas. The immediate effects of taking restricted drugs are severe headache, staggering stammering and clumsy movement. The drugs, in a slow but steady way, lead the addicts to sure immature death.

In order to solve this problem all kinds of intoxicating drugs should be under the direct control of the doctors. Parents and guardians should give special attention to the activities of their child. Effective programmes should be taken to solve the unemployment problem. Bad associations must be avoided. If all these steps are taken, the problem will be solved.

Drug addiction is a national problem. It is also a cause. Every citizen should be alert against the bad effects of drugs. Government, politicians, doctors, teachers, social workers, writers, journalist, artists all should come forward to fight out the curse.]]>

    <string name="c29"><![CDATA[In ancient times and middle ages, democracy was considered to be a form of government but in modem times it is not only a form of government but also a particular social organization according to the comments of C.D. Bums. As a form of government 1-lerodotus defines it as a government in which the ruling power of a state is legally vested, not in any particular class or classes but in the members of the community as a whole. Abraham Lincon defines it as a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Burns cons idlers democracy as a society in which every man ‘contributes some thought and feeling to the common life. To Sir Stafford Cripps democracy is a system of government in which every adult citizen is equally free to express his views and desires upon all subjects in whatever way he wishes and to influence the majority of his fellow citizens to decide according to those views.

R.H. Soltau points out four implications of democracy. Firstly it believes that truth will come out of the clash of opinion with opinion, that every Citizen may have something of value to contribute and must not be hindered in bringing it forward. Secondly, the state has no final truth to establish, and infallibility has no place in politics. Thirdly, the political right must be the same for all. Forcibly democracy is inseparable from a belief in methods of peaceful persuasion, in ultimate reasonableness of man and his response to rational arguments.

Democracy is of two types. The direct democracy is the type of government in which citizens directly sit in the assembly and participate in the affairs of the government. The indirect democracy is the type of government in which citizens are asked to elect their representatives to run the government on their behalf. Direct democracy was suitable for the small city states of ancient Greece only. Modern indirect democracy has, however, adopted certain methods of direct democracy which are termed as Initiative, Referendum and Recall. In initiative a certain number of votes may, by petition, compel the legislature to consider a particular proposal. In referendum all the citizens are required to vote on a certain issue and also to approve or disapprove a certain bill already passed by the legislature. In recall a certain number of electors compel a representative, by petition, to resign or submit to reselection.

Democracy has many virtues and it’s considered to be the best sort of government on the following grounds. Firstly, it is the only form of government in which those who exercise public authority can be subjected to the control of those in whose interest they are chosen to govern. Secondly, since in democracy every person is able to stand up for he rights and interests of the individual can be best safeguarded. Thirdly, in democracy the general prosperity attains a higher degree and is mare widely diffused in proportion to the around and variety of personal energies enlisted in promoting it. Fourthly. by allowing people to share in its administration, democracy elevates the masses of people, develops their faculties, stimulates interest among them in public affairs and strengthens their patriotism. Fifthly, since democracy rests on the consent of people and the principle of equality, it is more immune against revolution in comparison to other forms of government. Sixthly it serves as a training school for citizens. to Burns all government is a method of education but the best education is self education which is provided by democracy.

Democracy has its defects also. Firstly, it attaches undue importance to quantity rather than quality. According to Allama Iqbal, in democracy men are counted and not weighed. So it puts a stupid citizen and a wise statesman on the same footing. Secondly, it is the government by the poorest , the most ignorant and the most incapable who are necessarily numerous. Thirdly, according to Burns, democracy is the “cult of impotence” which underestimates the difficulty of government and overestimates the capacity of the common man. Fourthly, democracy is in-stable as h is easy to change the government frequently, and as such it is impossible to continue a policy. Fifthly, it is a breeding ground for agitators, flatterers, bosses and demagogues. Sixthly, being the rule of ignorant it does not appreciate the utility of intellectual growth and as such is indifferent to the growth of arts, science and literature.

There are many other grave defects in democracy. Lucky thinks that corrupt ion is effective in democracy and reaches down to all classes of people. It is also very wasteful as general voters are not found careful to the public purse. Moreover, the candidates spend huge sums in their campaign. Some critics say that democracy attempts at doing too much resulting only in too much legislation and less accomplishment. It also attempts to do only vote catching things. To Lecky it ensures neither better government, nor greater liberty. Prickliness and emotionalism being two defects of mob are the defects of democracy also. The tremendous power behind a democratic government makes it all the more dangerous if it becomes intolerant. To Baldwin democracy is two years behind dictatorship for in emergency prompt action is needed which is not possible in democracy because it is stow at a decision and has to consider too many interests.]]></string>

There is a great éclat throughout the country on this day. Children pass the night in very excitement and make various preparations. Some of them use fire-work and decorate and illuminate their houses. As soon as the day dawn, all rise from their beds. They go to the pond or river and take bath. They put on new and finest dress. They use ator and make friendly embracement with one another. All take shemai and other kinds of sweets. Sweets are also distributed among the poor, Friends and relatives. The poor people flock to the house of the rich and are fed there. There is a flow of great joy and merriment everywhere.

This being over, all proceeds towards the maidan to say prayer in congregation. Children also flock there in a large member to see the assembly of the people, When the prayer is over, the Imam delivers khutba. He explains the significance of this day. He directs people to do their duties to others. He tells then to forget all enmity and rivalry among them. In the end, they raise their hands to Munajat for pardon their sins to Allah.

Last of all, people embrace one another and invite to take sweet to every one’s house. In the evening, they visit the house of their relatives and friends and pass their times in marry making. It is our foremost duty to forget all enmity among us.

    <string name="c40"><![CDATA[The 21st of February is a historical day of Bangladesh. The day is popularly called Amar Ekushe. It is a source of inspiration and energy of the Bangladeshi. It is a protest against exploitation and injustice. This day is a government holiday. We observe the day every year in a befitting manner.

On the 21st February in 1952, our language martyrs created a history and the day became memorable. In the then Pakistan we were majority in number. But the west Pakistanis controlled everything of the country. They understood it very clearly that their control over the majority would not last long if our language and literature were not crushed. In order to materialize their policy, they declared that Urdu would be the only state language of Pakistan. The very declaration was a crime. The opposition camp was not strongly organized in the babyhood of Pakistan. The University of Dhaka has always been politically sensitive. The brave students of the university came forward to meet the challenge. They opposed the declaration and started a movement. This movement is called the Language Movement. On the 21st February of 1952 the students of the university violated section 144 and brought out a procession protesting against the illegal and unjustified declaration. The rulers of Pakistan wanted to crush the movement at the point of the gun. But they failed to do so. Salam, Jabbar, Barkat, Rafiq, Shafiq and other unknown boys established the right of our mother tongue at the cost of their life. Not only that, Bangladeshi nationalism was born in the blood of the language martyrs.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the 21st February as International Mother Language Day as a mark of respect to our language Movement of 1952.

Ekushe February is a national day of Bangladesh. But today it is an international day. The nation observes the day in befitting manner; the national flag is hoisted half-mast. Barefooted processions are brought out at dawn. The Mazars of the martyrs at Azimpur graveyard are visited and Fateha in offered there. All news media, offices, institutions, organizations Political parties, associations etc. follow their own programmers, The day’s programme includes seminars, cultural functions, exhibitions, competitions etc.

Ekushe February teaches us to protest against injustice and exploitation, it teaches us to love our motherland and mother tongue. It helps us to discover ourselves.

Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. Who has not heard of his famous saying Early rising definitely makes a man healthy, and so does the habit of going early to bed. Given health and fair share of luck, a man may become wealthy. But, perhaps, it is more appropriate to say that a wise man goes to bed and rises early than to say that rising or sleeping early makes a man wise.

In Pakistan and other sub-tropical and Sub tropical countries, the sun shines very brightly all the day. It becomes as hot as the day advances that one finds it more and more difficult to do any kind of work, physical or intellectual, with any degree of efficiency. The laborer sweat profusely, and the heat of the sun tires him more than his work does. The student feels sleep and cannot do the problems before him. The athlete cannot train as much as he would like to, for the simple reason that it is too hot. We know very well that lessons given in the morning are better learnt and longer remembered than those given in the afternoon. Is it not, then, advisable for all of us to rise from our beds early and go about our respective business as early as possible rather than wait for the day to become intolerably hot.

If a farmer begins to plough his fields, a traveler starts on his journey, or a laborer begins his work, while the other of his calling are still asleep, he finishes his task ahead of them. Besides, he can do much more than the others. The fact that one has already done some of one's work before other have started to do theirs, gives one a peculiar sense of confidence and satisfaction.

Early morning is the best part of the day for scholars and other intellectual workers to go about their work. They are fresh after the night's rest, and there is not much noise at this time to disturb them.

Morning is also the best time for physical exercise. It is so, not only because the weather is cool, but also because the atmosphere is very clear and quiet. A man, going for a walk before sunrise, enjoys the quiet atmosphere of the roadside even more than the cool breeze of the morning. In industrial areas and even in the countryside, the air is loaded with dust and smoke throughout the day. At night much of this dust and smoke settles down. So a man, walking, or taking any other exercise in the morning, breathes in much cleaner air than he may do in the evening.]]></string>

At first, he knew it only as a destructive force-in the form of lightning. Whenever there was rain or thunder, he saw a flash of lightning produced by atmospheric electricity. Sometimes it struck trees, animals and even men. Even now some languages have the same word for both lightning and electricity.

But in modern times, man has brought electricity under control. He can produce it and use it as he likes. It is used in lightning streets, houses and shops in towns and cities and even in villages. Radio, cinema and television are all worked by electricity. Fans, refrigerator, heaters and air conditioners would be impossible without it. In the kitchen, electric cookers are fast replacing the hearts and ovens heated by fire. We can send messages all over the world by telephone and telegram, which owe their efficiency, even their very existence, to electricity. Electric bells and burglar alarms have reduced the number of thefts.

Electricity is the most powerful, and at the same time the cheapest means of moving heavy machinery. Almost all modern large-scale industries depend on supply of electric current. These days, it is quite usual to determine how far a country has been industrialized by referring to its supply of electric power. Electric current is also extensively used in metallurgy. When it is passed through the solution of a metal, it separates its impurities.

All this shows that electricity is a very useful form of energy perhaps we can say that the world would be too dull a place for us to live in if this servant of ours were taken away from us.

Like water and fire, however, electricity is a good servant but a bad master we must never handle it carelessly. An electric shock will cause sudden death or render a person paralyzed for life so whenever we find that anything is wrong with an electric fitting. We should call in a trained electrician to attend to it.]]></string>

Yet what about environment? which is getting depleted polluted and oxygen less day by day without which the survival of mankind would become a thing of the past and the worst of all, people are still not aware of it. They are still guided by the so called rules of economics to earn profit and that economic development is a panacea to all ills.

Today we find the whole world caught mercilessly in the perilous jaw of Environmental Pollution and ecological degradation.

The ill lies not in some single phase of life but it is multidimensional. It is desolating the green woods, eroding some of the most fertile tracks of land banishing the most precious species from the wild life and also all violently hurling millions of hazardous waste, toxic fumes and lethal components in the air and water ways.

These all listed elements have played havoc with the Environment. CFC the only manmade chemicals is used as coolants in refrigerators, air conditioner and as solvent for cleaning computers and circuit boards. Evidence indicate that the chemicals are finding their way into the• atmosphere and destroying the ozone layer whereas ozone layer filters out most of the ultraviolet rays of the sunlight. It is believed that the destruction of ozone layer would dramatically increase the skin cancer and a drop in crop yield etc.

Similarly, cyclical fluctuation in temperature known as Green house effect is another contributory factor of the Environmental Pollution. This is building up the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which gradually increases the temperature, which would have an ultimate effects like the rise in the level of sea, Global warming, and melting of ice sheets in the polar regions, which would bring a drastic change in the environment.

Air pollution due to the release of toxic fumes in the air is creating hazardous effects not only on the human beings but also on the, animals and birds, proper and clean atmosphere is a requirement for the survival of life on the planet.

Toxic waste goes untreated in the water ways, especially in the third world countries, a statistics reveals that 90 percent of the industries in Pakistan have no water treatment plant and as a result of this negligence almost all quantity of chemical waste is deposited in our main water sources i.e. Rivers and lakes.

Apart from these main causes, there are some subsidiary causes as well, which are gradually depleting the environment. Among them is, noise pollution, due to the production of auto-mobiles, Ignorance to environment is another cause of the pollution especially with respect to the third world countries and the other developing nations. Neatly over population is another contributory factor, over population has led to an increase in the demand and production of the industrial goods, which eventually plays havoc with the environment.

Scientific research should undergo a change, natural source of energy should be utilized for all practical purposes, for example auto-mobiles, refrigeration etc. The member countries should develop a fund for the research of an alternative form of energy which would be less hazardous, for health and environment.

Most important effort was Earth Summit in 1992. Though united States held some reservation on the cutting back at industrial pollution, yet even then the countries proceeded with their argument. The world at Global level condemned United States for being a major hold in this concern. This Earth Summit was followed by Copenhagen conference in Denmark which dealt the issue relating to global warming and pushed the participants to do a nationwide legislation in this respect. Though positive results are still awaiting, yet it is hoped that things would ultimately be put to right.

These agencies with exception to Green Peace whose sole motive is inculcating awareness regarding environment have been successful in promoting formulation of policies. Agencies like World Bank and Asian

Development Bank attaches a condition of environmental concern with their package of aid and loan which they give to the developing countries. In this way substantial efforts have been made towards the awareness of this concern regarding degradation of environment and global warming.

Dialogue between NGO's EPA and local authority are required as for this realization. Whereas at International level, agencies donating money and giving loans should do no bargaining in attaching condition of environment protection with their package. This is not "my" world. This is "our" world and the effort at the level "us" is required for all practical reasons.]]></string>

    <string name="c42"><![CDATA[Bangladesh is mainly an agricultural country. Agriculture is the base of its e4conomy. The man who cultivates land is called a farmer. Farmers grow crops which is the most important thing of basic needs. They are the backbone of our country.

There are three classes of farmers in our country. The rich farmers the, middle class farmers and the landless farmers. Most of the farmers in our country include middle class with a small piece of land. Farmers of this class usually till land with their own bullocks and they hardly can grow much food as per their demand. The rich farmers are very few in numbers and they get a small share of crops with the land owners.

The methods of farming in our country are much backdated. Majority of the farmers are poor and illiterate. They cannot afford to buy modern tools of cultivation. They plough their land with bullocks and use sickle to cut the grains. They also do not know how to cultivate land in the scientific method. This results unsatisfactory yield from the cultivated land.

The life standard of the farmers in our country is very low and they are to suffer even from the lack of fundamental needs of life. They are ill-fated, ill-treated and deprived from the light of modern science. They work hard but do not get proper nutriment. As a result they suffer from various diseases. Their children do not receive good education and follow the path of their for-fathers.

Some effective steps should be taken to improve the socio-economic conditions of our farmers. They should be taught the modern scientific method of cultivation. They should be given hybrid seeds, right kind of pesticides and balance dose of fertilizers so that they may grow more food. Justified price of the agricultural production should be ensured so that farmers may get right price. Irrigation facilities should be ensured and farmer should get loan on low interest.

The development of our country is mainly dependent of the improvement of our agriculture. We should not neglect our farmers and all possible steps should be taken to improve their condition.

    <string name="c46"><![CDATA[Once Bangladesh was the store house of crops. But those happy days have gone away. Now, we suffer much from food deficit. It has become a cha challenge to our existence.

Mainly the condition of food problem depends on production of crops and its utilization. Now our farmers suffer from real valuation and utilization of their gotten crops. They may be rich if they get these facilities.

There are many causes of food problem in Bangladesh. Our cultivation system and other kinds of ways of growing food are defective and unscientific. Mainly, natural calamities like flood, cyclone, drought and insects destroy our standing crops every year. Moreover, for the illiteracy of our farmers cannot produce desired food. That is why we have food problem.

There are some dishonest businessmen who make artificial problem by storing food for more benefit. Here the government has a strong role to play. It must at once arrest the dishonest businessmen and punish them. The government should import the more needed food items such as rice, sugar, salt, chilies and onions. Even the government has to prevent black marketing by police force.

To solve the problem scientific methods of cultivation and co-operative farming system should be introduced. The farmers should be supplied with better seeds, manure, loan etc. by the Government. The instruments of irrigation system for the dry season should also be corrected by the Government. Above all, steps should be taken to remove illiteracy from the society, so that the farmers can learn easily to utilize mechanical ploughs and to apply insecticides and fertilizers timely.

In conclusion, we can say, food problem is both nature-caused and man-made. We should activate all our efforts and expertise to remove these causes, and make Bangladesh self-sufficient in food.

Without the help and whole hearted co-operation of women is not less important than that of men. A woman is the sister, the mother and the guardian of the family. A woman rears the infants, builds up them as a worthy citizen and leader. Women also play an important role in the economic field. So, to manage the family in a decent way a man depends on his wife. A housewife performs her household-affairs keeps poultry and thus helps the family economically.

Our prophet Hazrat Muhammad (sm) laid great importance on the education of both male and female. Without education a woman can’t do anything properly for her children and also can’t help them to lead a worthy life.

Some orthodox people speak against female education and create obstacle to it. It fact, it is an offence. We must educate women in nursing and household management, child-care, sewing and so on. Thus, they will be able to earn their living independently.

In our country Government has taken various steps of female education. For the leaner of secondary schools and higher secondary colleges female students are free from fee. As a result, the percentage of female education is increasing day by day and they are taking part in the developing works of the country.

Female education is a vital need to our developing Bangladesh. So, we should be up and doing for the spread of female education.

    <string name="c41"><![CDATA[The world stands with a limited area. Everything on the surface of the earth should be done in a planned way. So a family should also be planned. To plan a family means to have a desired number of children on the family.

The population of our country is growing rapidly at the rate of 2.16 percent every year. If the population additional things, But our resources are limited. As a result they will suffer and create problems. A small family is a happy family - say the wise. It can give its members proper food, clothing, shelter, education and medical treatment. But it is clothing, shelter, education and medical treatment. But it is not possible on the part of a big family to do all these things. So every family must be planned.

Though Bangladesh has one of the effective networks of family planning. People in the lower class and in the village are painfully unaware about the benefits. The birth control items which are distributed to them free remain unused.

The attitude of the general public towards the problem of over-population is casual. They do not see the logic that more children mean less food. Lack of education is the greatest cause behind the failure of family planning in our country. Many women in the lower class become mothers almost every year so, they are not allowed to have time for education. Whereas the advancement of women is integrally related to the reducing of birth rate.

The ultimate responsibility lies with the government. It has to that people received adequate education about family planning, and it also to guarantee that children born are provided well and given food and the largely unemployed graduates.

All the adult members of our families should follow the suggestions given by the family planning authorities. Beside this the government should provide more facilities of all kinds within the reach of the people of all levels.

In conclusion I can say we must plan our families if we want to make our families happy and our hunger, illiteracy misery etc.

    <string name="c47"><![CDATA[Points: Introduction – Friendship is a blessing – It makes our life joyous – The selection of a true friend is difficult – A friend in need is a friend indeed – Conclusion.

Good friends are rare in, this world. We have several acquaintances but a few friends. This is so because real friendship is a complex thing made up of several things. It is rarely that we get such a combination of things in human beings. A disinterested friend is rare.

Man is a social animal. He cannot live alone. He needs companions. Friendship is, therefore, the basis on which a society has been built up. It is such a company which makes a man perfect. Friendship is a wonderful experience. It is a blessing. A person without friends is an unfortunate being. He is either an unsocial or abnormal person.

Friendship makes our life joyous and pleasant. All of us need friends to console us when we are unhappy, to cheer up when we are depressed, to help us when we are in need and to be with us when we are happy. The joys of friendship are many. With a small set of good friends around, one feels at home in this world. A friendless person is always lonely and sad. He cannot see much meaning in the life around him.

The selection of a true friend is really very difficult. Perhaps this has become more difficult with the advancement of material values in our society. The age of material values has made a man selfish. But true friendship is free from all selfishness. He is interested in your welfare and happiness. He does his best to help you. You don’t have to ask him for help. But if he is not aware of your difficulties you feel no hitch in telling him. Friendship flourishes on mutual trust. When that is missing there is something wrong with friendship. A good friend is prepared to sacrifice his own interest for the sake of his friend. A selfish man can never be a good friend. In friendship, as in love, you give. You don’t withhold. If you do so you are not a good friend.

There are quarrels even among good friends. But these quarrels are not always the end of friendship. A good friend’s attitude to these quarrels is generous. Sometimes there are serious misunderstandings. He tries to remove them through a frank discussion. Borrowing, it is believed, is ruinous to friendship. It is perhaps true. But can one avoid borrowing from a friend if one is in need! A friend in need is a friend indeed friendship is a spiritual relationship. The harmony we find between two friends is spiritual harmony. Happiness lies in getting together. A good friend is, in short, a rare possession and one must thank God if one get a really good friend.]]></string>
    <string name="c48"><![CDATA[Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere and its oceans, a change that is believed to be permanently changing the Earth’s climate. The 29th century is experiencing a continued increase of Earth’s mean atmospheric temperature by about 1.4 degrees F and about two thirds of it occurring since 1980. This is global warming is affecting the nature’s balance and has a huge impact on life like continued heat waves, and sudden occurrence of storms and floods.

Causes

The causes are many of which the main culprit is the increase in the greenhouse gases that is produced by burning fossil fuel and deforestation, thus intensifying the greenhouse effect leading to global warming. The four main contributors of the greenhouse effect are, water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and ozone.

Mining for coal and oil releases methane in the atmosphere. More ever the leakage from natural gas fields and landfills are additional source of methane. Excessive cutting down of the trees is another factor causing global warming. When deforestation happens the efficiency by which carbon dioxide is stored and oxygen released by the green plants are decreased to a huge rate in turn causing increased concentration of carbon dioxide that leads to increased greenhouse effect.

The nitrous oxide from fertilizers, gases used for refrigeration and industrial processes are other factors that cannot be forgotten as the cause of Global Warming.

Another source of methane is methane clathrate, a compound containing large amounts of methane trapped in the crystal structure of ice. As methane escapes from the Arctic seabed, the rate of global warming will increase significantly.

Ice caps and glaciers reflect sunlight, bouncing high temperature sun -rays back into space away from the Earth. When these icecaps are removed the earth gets warmer as the dark oceans absorb much thermal radiation from the sun.

Some regions may be wet with rain and some areas will suffer drought due to global warming. The climatic changes happen due to global warming. Seasonal changes are unpredictable unexpected thunderstorms might result as mentioned earlier.

The burning of wood (should be reduced to a greater extent) releases oxidizable carbon to the atmosphere whose presence in greater amount causes the elevation of temperature.

There is strong evidence that emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were the major cause of the recent abnormal warming. Like carbon CFC do not trap heat but in the presence of UV rays the chlorine gets detached from CFC, drifts up into the stratosphere and these unattached chlorines catalytically convert Ozone molecules into Oxygen molecules depleting the ozone layer.

Effects

Global warming might cause increased incidence of Lyme disease, dengue fever and malaria because the mosquitoes that are the transmitting agents for these diseases requires winter temperatures of about 18 degrees Celsius for their survival.

The increased floods and damages to sewage and water infrastructures further encourage the spread of diseases.

The melting glaciers, polar ice caps, and other frozen grounds are causing and will continue to cause the rise in sea levels. This will result in flooding and displacement of human population worldwide.

The fresh water polar ice caps melting into the salt- water oceans alter the ocean gulf- stream patterns causing major changes on the temperature pattern around the Earth. This changing environment and temperature in polar region will endanger the flora and fauna and imbalance in the ecosystem.

The ozone layer keeps out the ultra violet radiations from the sun that harms lives on the earth. Some human made gases rises into the atmosphere and destroys the ozone layer. Therefore global warming involves the pollution of the atmosphere, which in turn leads to the depletion of the ozone layer.

The global warming will delay the ozone recovery at Arctic regions making these people to be exposed to a ultra-violet dose, which is relatively higher. The penetration of the more ultra-violet radiations from the sun to the earth poses threats to lives like skin cancer.

Prevention

The burning of wood should be reduced to a greater extent as it releases oxidizable carbon to the atmosphere whose presence in greater amount causes the elevation of temperature. LPG stoves can replace the fire wood burning. Bio gas plants can be encouraged in village units. Composting will help you to dispose of biodegradable waste.

The use of CFCs is a major reason for depletion of the ozone layer causing global warming. The discharges and exhaust from automobiles also causes global warming. We could reduce it by identifying fuel-efficient cars, use bio-fuels, correct the engine design, or using an electric car.

By not wasting energy at home we can avoid to some extent the global warming. This includes shutting down the systems when not in usage and also buying energy efficient equipments. Solar energy, wind energy and hydro-electricity can be used that reduces the pollution of the atmosphere to a greater extent.

People should be reminded that they share the earth and its resources with the other species that keep the ecosystem balanced, if the balance is gone then the life if every single species is threatened and even humans will not be spared from this.

Planting trees is a very good start that can help diluting the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A single tree will absorb approximately one ton of carbon dioxide during its lifetime.

    <string name="c50"><![CDATA[Once Bangladesh was the store house of crops. But those happy days have gone away. Now it has become a challenge to our existence. The title of essay suggests that we do not grow enough food. Of our total people 80 percent live below the poverty line, which must be very shocking for nation.

Cause of growing less food:

Hostile Nature: Natural calamities like cyclones, storms, floods and drought are the destructive factors for our agriculture. Peasants remain completely dependent on the vagaries of nature.

Ancient land system: The ancient land system is one of the causes of growing fewer crops. As a result, the uses of modern appliances like the tractor which needs a larger land space to work on, becomes difficult.

Lack of agricultural knowledge: The farmers of our country are hard-working. But their knowledge of agriculture is not modern and scientific. They do not cultivate more than one crop on a piece of land every year. Neither do they alternate between crops and vegetables.

Small land: Bangladesh is a small country but her population is large. We cannot grow enough crops on the lands. Plantation of fruits and other foods is also severely limited in scope because of the shortage of land.

What to do: To ensure more production of food grains the government must stream-line, the distribution of fertilizer and the collection of the peasants’ about the benefits of having more than one- crop in one field.

Ways to control nature: Protecting the arable land from the ravages of natural calamities is huge task, and not to be done by the government alone, or not in one day. The government should co-ordinate to combine the efforts of all other organizations in putting banks on the rivers, digging cannels and irrigating the fields. As all this will involve huge funds, the authorities concertize and equipment.

On the small scale: The slogan “Grow more food” gets its real meaning when housewives feel the urge to make a food-garden in the backyard of their house.

Bangladesh will not be a happy country unless they grow more food slogan is materialized.

Good manners are unconsciously acquired in our childhood, but they can also be cultivated later on. Every human being should be treated with due respect and dignity. The animal instinct in us makes us rough and vulgar, but a cultured and civilized man is gentle and polite.

By good manners we understand the way in which a person should behave in society. One is expected to show respect ones elders. Good manners are necessary for everyone, in every walk of life. It is good manners to thank anybooy who does anything for you. When a waiter brings you a glass of water, you may thank him.

Good manners not only show our breeding but also our education, culture, our station in life and our intellectual level. It is rightly said, "Manners maketh man." It means that only a pars who has good manners is fit to be called a gentleman or a lady.

Good manners are a key to success in business. They are useful in forming new friendships and retaining old ones. Above all, they make us happy because we make others happy with our good manners. We can win over even our enemies by our good manners. On other hand, we can turn some of our good friends into enemies by our ill manners. Nobody likes an ill-mannered person.]]></string>
    <string name="c49"><![CDATA[The concept of globalization became popular after the collapse of Communism In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It is, in effect, the victory of capitalism and means trade without restrictions, free movement of capital and technology and the operation of a completely free market economy. Strangely, and understandingly, it does not sanction free movement of labour, from one country into another.
    
Globalization, in the first place, opens up new markets and provides opportunities for investment to industrialists and businessmen. Thus, if we make a rosy interpretation of this aspect of globalization, capital would flow from the developed countries like the US, UK, France, Germany and Japan into the developing states like ours and others like Bangladesh, Burma, Ethiopia and Peru. This capital plus the labour force available in these countries would make possible an industrial and agricultural revolution never heard of earlier. But, this does not happen. The capital flows to the multinational companies having their branches in the developing countries, and this capital is used to purchase raw material at very low prices, to send it to the developed countries.

Globalization can work wonders, in the industrial and commercial sense, if the working classes in the developing countries are educated and trained with foreign capital and with the money of feudal lords and capitalists inside. Then, the thousands and millions of laborers, workers and farmers can be invited to the advanced countries to get educated and to learn modern industrial and agricultural techniques to work in the advanced countries and to work in their own countries by turn.

Secondly, globalization means free trade or the lifting of restrictions of duties and taxes on imports and exports. It does not sound sensible on the part of the developed countries to open the free flow of their perfectly produced goods into the markets of the developing states where the same goods are either inferior or expensive. This kind of free trade will result in depressed sale of native goods, closure of factories and unemployment of the labour class in the less developed countries.

If the developed countries transfer their scientific methods and technologies to the developing countries generously and start educating the common people devotedly, the coming into force of "true globalization" sometime in the future will become possible. Until the developing world comes up to the level of the developed world sociologically, economically and politically, it will be impossible to have one world economy and social system.

The developing or backward world looks with suspicion and awe at the globalization plans of the developed world. It is time the governments of the developing countries woke up to the realities of the world situation and took revolutionary steps to take away the wealth and resources in the hands of the corrupt minority to spend on the education, training and progress of the masses. It is time they started acting on economic programmes to construct dams, produce cheap electricity and to increase agricultural and industrial production for the general uplift of society.]]></string>

A small but smooth ground is quite sufficient for this game. The ground where Ha-du-du is played is divided into two equal parts. A line is drawn across the middle of the field. Each party must have equal number of players. There is no limit to this number. Any number of players can take part in it.

The players of both the teams stand face to face in a line or in the form of a semi-circle. Each party stands in one part of the ground. One player of a party runs to the middle line and suddenly falls upon the players of the opponent party. He utters all along the words ‘Ha-du-du’ holding his breath and tries to touch a player of the opponent party. If he can touch and reach his own area, he remains in ‘life’. The opponent player or players touched by him are ‘dead’, that is, disqualified from playing. They kept outside the ground until a player of their party can touch some players of the opponent party. Then they come back to life and join the game again. Thus the parties by turns send players, one at a time, to the opponent’s area. The game comes to an end when all the players of a party are dead. The party that survives is declared to have won the game.

Among many foreign games like cricket, football, badminton etc., Ha-du-du is the game of our own. It bears the sign of our cultural heritage. The village people of our country still love this game. If we go abroad to display our national games, we feel proud to carry this game over there.

The Arabs were superstitious, ignorant and unbelievers. They lost their moral character. The Arabs were so much corrupted. Under such circumstances Allah sent our beloved Prophet Hazrat Muhammad’s (sm.) thee to teach the naughty Arabs good virtues.

Hazrat Muhammad’s (sm.) was born at Mecca in Arabia in 570A. D. His father’s name was Abdullah. Hazrat Muhammad’s (sm.) lost his father before his birth. His mother Amina also died when he was of sex years only. His grandfather, Abdul Muttaalib then brought him up. After his death, his uncle Abu Talib took over his charge.

The Arabians were then idolaters. They drank wine. They quarrelled with one another. This shocked the boy Muhammad. He always thought over removing all these things.

Hazrat married Khadija, a rich lady. This removed his want. Then he began to meditate on Allah. He did this for fifteen years in the cave of Hera. At the age of forty, he preached Islam.

The Meccans conspired to kill Hazrat Muhammad’s (sm.). So he left Mecca for Medina with his followers. It is called the Hizrat. He built an Empire at Medina. He was the builder of the Muslim society. Hazrat Muhammad’s (sm.) performed his last Hizrat in 633 A. D. at the age of sixty-three only.

Hazrat Muhammad’s (sm.) is the Prophet of Muslims. He is the last and the greatest of Prophets. He was kind, truthful, generous pride less and sweet tongued. He loved the children and the whole of mankind.

The social position of a dishonest man is serious miserable. He leads an unhappy and mournful life. Because, when his dishonesty comes out or is proved nobody believes him anymore. His name and fame of the past is lost.

All the great men of the world were honest. Our prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Sm) was the real symbol of honesty. Socrates, Aristotle, Hazrat Omar (R), Hazrat Abu Bakar (R) and many other men were honest in their words and deeds. In the history their honesty is immortal.

The poor or the rich, the high or low everybody may be honest. To speak the truth is the best way to be honest. The man who always speaks the truth is also loved by Allah. The story of the Hazrat Abdul Kader Jilani (R) shows the way of truthfulness to us and the obedience to his mother advice. On the contrary, the story of the liar cowboy remembers the result of his falsehood.

The real success of life depends on honesty. Honesty depend men and dishonest ruins men. In the Hadith “A dishonest man will never be allowed to enter into heaven”. So, if we wish to become successful in life we should try to be honest. We should always bear in mind that honesty is the best policy.

An unhealthy man is the most unfortunate man in the world. He can’t do what he likes. He leads a miserable life. He may be rich but he can’t be happy. All are charm less to him.

A healthy bagger is happier than a king who has lost his health. It is said, “Health is wealth”. A healthy man can do and eat anything he likes. He can enjoy his life fully. As health is a source of all happiness.

It is sure that “A sound mind lies in sound body”. So, if we can keep our body sound we can enjoy the fruits of health. In order to preserve our health we should obey the rules of health. In eating and drinking, we should be temperate. We should regularly sleep and rise early. We should take physical exercise regularly. We must be neat and clean our teeth wash our body and cloths, comb, our hair every day. A man who prays five times every day, he keeps himself neat and clean easily.

we know that “Excess of everything is very bad”. So we should not over eating and dirking. We should not take over exercise too.

Health is the key to all earthly pleasures and glories. Health is the main asset of life. We should always re member that health is wealth.

Millions of factories in all parts of the world are sending huge quantities of carbon dioxide and other poisonous gases in the atmosphere. This is not the whole story. They are pouring continuous streams of harmful chemicals into the rivers of the world. Every hour our cars, buses and aeoplanes are discharging deadly poisons into our atmosphere. There are three kinds of pollutions which we are facing.

1. Atmospheric Pollution
2. Water Pollution
3. Noise Pollution

Efforts are being done to control the pollution throughout the world. The hole of ozone layers is being tried to repair. Many special organization has been made to control the pollution. The electronic and print media is trying to produce complete awareness about the pollution and its causes and about its results in future. I think following attempts can be made to control the pollution.

1. Complete awareness should be provided to people by using electronic and print media.
2. It should be ordered to all factory and mills owners that they must destroy their wastes in the most careful way.
3. Recycling of the wastes should be introduced in factories.
4. The smoke of the transporting vehicles should be controlled by using special devices.
5. The rattling of machines and the pressure horns should be avoided and the noisy process should be controlled.
6. The discharge of the wastes into the rivers should be stopped. ]]></string>

We have a large population. Only about one-fourth of our people can read and write. The rest of our people are illiterate. It is very sad. If our people can attain the ability to read and write, the nation will see the light of hope.

Newspapers, periodicals, magazines etc., are full of information’s and instructions. Records of all kinds and accounts are maintained in books. Documents of all kinds are written. Secret information’s and news are sent through letters. Modern methods of cultivation and other necessary instructions have been written in books. Doctors prescribe medicine and give instructions in writing. Even the religious books including the holy Quran are written. The person who can’t read and write is deprived of all the facilities of education. He remains ignorant. Ignorance is equivalent to darkness. We cannot do anything important in darkness.

We have clearly realized that illiteracy is a curse. We must get rid of the curse of illiteracy. There are lots of boys and girls of school going age in our country. Some go to school and many tend cows or help their parents in the field of agriculture. In this way majority of our children are going illiterate. If this is allowed to continue, our country will never get rid of curse of illiteracy. Now our primary education is free. It is a matter of great pleasure that our government have taken some steps to make primary education compulsory. Beside this, proper importance has been given on adult education. It is true that all the illiterate grown up people cannot be brought under the programme at time. It is also true that only a few grown up illiterate people of the project area have responded to call. The illiterate women do not come forward. It is due to their ignorance and poverty. The adult education programme will be crowned with success if our illiterate adults want to get rid of the curse.

Encouraging response should come from our illiterate people to remove illiteracy from Bangladesh. Some bright examples should be brought before them. The local leaders and competent authorities should motivate and encourage our people so that they come forward to make the programme a success.

Jute grows best in moist climate. Low and alluvial land is most suitable for jute cultivation. Bangladesh is the store-house of jute. In our country it grows well in the districts of Mymensingh, Faridpur, Pabna, Bogura, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Comilla, etc. Jute is also grown in India, Thailand and China.

Farmers plough and manure in their land well. Then they sow seeds in March or April. Jute plants grow up by leaps and bounds. Weeds and grass are rooted out duly. Plants attain maturity after four or five months of sowing.

Jute plants are cut down in July and August. Then they are tied up into bundles and kept under water to get rotten. When they become rotten within a few days, then they are taken out of wither and barks are separated from their stalks. Next they are washed in watered and dried up in the sun. The dried fibers look polished and golden. Thus, jute becomes ready to be sold.

Jute is very useful to us. Different types of mats, ropes, painters, brush, false hair and great variety of our domestic use are made from jute.

It is a matter of sorrow that now-a-days jute has lost much of its importance in the world market. Artificial fibers have taken its place. Still then, it is a great asset to our country. We should make all-out efforts to retain its glory as the golden fiber of Bangladesh.

    <string name="c59"><![CDATA[You can elaborate your essay with the help of some examples from your study of history. Mainly the argument will be philosophical. Mark the following hints

1. Knowledge its definition and importance
2. How can knowledge become power, A man of knowledge is powerful because he can understand the things around him and makes their best use.
3. A man of knowledge can understand his own self, own talents and can develop them.
4. He understands others and can guide them.
5. Examples from history.
6. A man of knowledge can understand God, commandments and the teachings of religion

Knowledge is the source of light which guides us in all the works of life. The entire progress of mankind is due to knowledge. In the modern days knowledge is the only basis of individual and national progress and prosperity. All the hopes about bright future and golden age are associated with the acquisition of knowledge.

Science has given mankind an enormous power. All the scientists were men of knowledge. Consider how these men of knowledge gained power themselves and enabled their fellow beings to share equally the rewards thereof. Before the advancement of learning and science man lived in the dark ages. To him the things and forces of nature were understandable. Hence he interpreted them in terms of deity and worshipped them. The clouds and rains the thunderstorm the mountains and valleys. The deserts and forests the rivers and oceans and a!1 other phenomena of nature were insurmountable for man. The forces of these things were attributed to the gods and hence man bowed his head before offered sacrifices to them and did many other ridiculous things.(4essay.blogspot.com) Even the wild beasts of jungles and the them crawling reptiles were taken to be gods. But now the knowledge has changed the entire attitude of man toward these things. They are no longer worship able gods and lords but they are the servants of mankind. Due to the power of knowledge man has brought these things under control to the best of his advantage, All the inventions of science have afforded a lot of power to man. The huge machines, the gigantic ships, the railway trains, the electricity and finally the atomic energy are all the manifestations of that power. So much so that the man is trying to reach moon and other planets in this sputnik age.

A man of knowledge can understand his own self. He can have a full measure of talents and capacities and can thus develop them. This enables him to derive benefit out of them and to make the desired progress in life. An illiterate man, on the other hand, can never realize his inherent capacity and so he is seen working by the roadside braking stones or doing some other petty laborious job which does not bring him full reward

Moreover, a man of knowledge can fully understand his fellow-men-their needs, their inclinations, their difficulties and their social and political circumstances. Having a close scrutiny of his fellow, beings a man of knowledge can help them, can lead them and can enable them to steer clear out of their difficulties. The pages of history are full of the accounts of the great leaders, writers, philosophers and teachers who helped and guided nations in their anxious moments. Quaid-eAzam was the most desired man to help the Indian Muslims in the hour of need. Dr. Allama Muhammad Iqbal was the guide and philosopher whose knowledge instilled a new life in the Muslims, enlightened them and gave them a philosophy with which they fought the twofold battle of freedom and gained a separate home-land-our dearest Pakistan.

A man of knowledge can understand God in the real sense of the word. He can have divine knowledge; understand the teachings of the religion and the commandments of God. There goes a proverb in Persian which tells us that an illiterate man can have no recognition of God. The power that a divine can get excels everything in this temporal world. No one can very well imagine the power that the prophets and seers had over the world and the force that is still there in the Heavenly Message which they brought to mankind.]]></string>

They do some jobs not for livelihood but for the enjoyment of the mind. And this kind of work of a man may be named as his hobby.

Like the average people, I have also a hobby. Hobby differs from man to man. One can choose drawing, painting, swimming, playing, gardening, and stamp collecting and so on as his hobby.

From my very childhood, I am very fond of gardening. My garden is situated beside the little window of my room.

When I first selected that place for my garden, the place was full of bushes. I worked hard to clean that. After cleaning, I fenced the land very strongly. Fencing protects the garden from various animals like goat, cow, sheep etc.

After fencing it, I began collecting plants of various flowers. I bought some plants from market. I planted all the plants with great care. I give fertilizer, cow dung and water them regularly.

And now my garden is full of various flowers. My favorite flower is rose. Besides rose, I have Tagar, Bakul, belli, Gandharaj, Rajnighanda etc. and many other flowers in my garden. When all the flowers bloom, my joys know no bounds.

However, to make a garden is not easy at all. Good care is very important for gardening. Watering, weeding, planting are some of the works of a garden. Every day, after coming from school, I work in my garden for one or two hours.

Somebody wonders why I spend my time in this work. But I think it is not possible to study all the time. Our mind also seeks recreation. Recreation is a part of work. After seeing the beautiful flowers, my mind becomes cheerful. Moreover, the work in my garden keeps me aloof from bad companies. Apart from this, I earn some money by selling flowers from my garden. So my hobby has become a source of money.

This is all what I can say about my hobby. I enjoy my hobby very much. This is a source of great pleasure and enjoyment for me. Whenever I feel sad, I go to my garden and that comforts me.

    <string name="c60"><![CDATA[The true meaning of civilization has not become hundred percent clear despite many centuries of so called civilized life. Each nation, or society, calls itself civilized without exactly knowing the real connotation of civilization. Even backward nations have something to fall back upon; they harp upon their glorious past and their heritage in case they cannot boast of any positive achievements in the twentieth century. They credit themselves with spiritual metaphysical traits and are at pains to prove their superiority over advanced modern societies which have worked through materialistic values of life which are beyond their reach. Science, technology and modern inventions are spurned at because they distract their attention from other-worldly pursuits that their respective religious imbibe.

Civilization connotes culture and refinement the qualities of head and heart of man, which lift him above the state of primitive man. Love, charity, spirit and sacrifice, regard for truth and honesty as well as a sense of responsibility to, the state and society are some of the essential characteristics of a civilized person in modern society. It is worthwhile to compare these characteristics of the modern age with those of earlier ages. There are evident points of contrast, we find. The modern comforts of life which were similarly absent in the other civilizations. The term material comforts of life implies good food, sound health, good clothing, nice shelter, nice company, a high standard of living as well as peace aM security are considered more important than the aspects related to spiritual pursuits which are intended to lead to peace and happiness of the soul, thus elevating it to Good hood.

In modern civilization the pursuit of material wealth, rather than spiritual, has became an all-engrossing, all-embracing, pursuits. Wordsworth called this state of affairs that were fast gripping industrial England in the nineteenth century in his beautiful sonnets-The World is too much; according to him, material wealth is a lorded boon to which we have given our hearts away. Earning and spending have become all the important occupations of man. Nevertheless, this pursuit of material values of life is considered a healthy activity that leads to the promotion of industries and employment. It leads to the general increase in the national dividend and utilization of the resources of country for the satisfaction of the various requirements of its citizens. This very sordid pursuits goes III provide for employment to workmen, facilities to business for investment and expansion of productive activities and thereby revenue to the state In modern civilization, a factory giving employment to a few thousand and people is considered to be a wiser national investment than the Selling up of a poorhouse which may provide merely food and shelter to an equal number.

The next important characteristic of modern civilization is the importance given to ones appearance thus forgetting that appearances are often deceptive. A person is judged by the dress he wears, his general demeanor and the connections he has rather than the intrinsic qualities he may possess. The advanced Western nations have contributed to the inflow of sex and promiscuity in the modern society.

We can notice quite a few other characteristics of modern civilization in the context of our society. Education has come to play a significant role in persons life; it is no longer the domain of the privileged few. Opportunities are offered to every individual to educate him and his progeny as ignorance and illiteracy have had their sway over the masses for centuries and their evil effects are too well known to be by past. Elementary education is provided free of cost to all those who are willing to benefit community. Health Schemes have added to the general health and well being of the masses.

Independence, and with it the advent of modern scientific ideas and achievement have contributed to higher moral and patriotic character. The people are now conscious of their freedom and are enlarging their outlook from the narrow bounds of their castes, creed, religion are community'. Time is not far off when a national barrier will also be a hindrance in the free and' creative thinking of the modern man and we shall, indeed, be able to have a wider, more varied and exciting international outlook. There is all urgency in the common man to day which impels to take an active interest in the happening around him. International cooperation and co-existence is being practiced all around. The advanced nations are fast coming to the rescue of their less fortunate brethren, thus fastening common global ties. Modern civilization has given an impetus to a feeling of fellow sympathy and brotherhood among the various peoples.

With the broadening of outlook, modern civilization has strengthened the bounds of nationalism and, inter-nationalism at the expense of family ties, the old joint-family system is going away. Relationships except when they, are from the direct line, are loosening their grip. The family is now narrowing down and it includes only man, wife' and their children. Family paining has led to the thinning of the family and very seldom do modern parents have more than two or three children compared to the average of eight to ten children for family a few decades ago. The joint family that housed together a hundred a hundred members with the four walls of a, single house and stood firm like a rock' against shocks and' setbacks has been broken up into a number of small families living separately generally from hand to mouth and with no stamina or protection, from misfortunes or distress or illness. The solid and strong; responsibilities which, the joint family system 'produced are no ' longer to be seen, in the modern society where the head of the small family unit has to fight his way singly, devoid of the strong protection, of the' united living of a large joint family.

Despite these handicaps, modern civilization may be considered superior to, and better than the older civilization in many ways. Even though there is a. trend towards individualism, the collective feelings of community, nation and the world as, a whole have greatly developed and there is now a greater sense of unity in the making. Science and technology' have brought human beings together by speedy means of transport and communication, thereby the minds and thinking of human being, closer. Whereas man has gained an individual freedom, his common existence has been bound strongly with other human beings.

If mankind is able to do some constructive thinking in the direction of removal of ignorance; illiteracy, want, inequality and injustice and if tan also prevent the scourge 'of future wars modern civilization, would be something' really to be proud of, we would have achieved a miracle that has been man's ideal since the millennium. Although scientific progress in Pakistan is not yet up to the mark, it can be safely predicted that Pakistan is now taking her legitimate place as a, civilized and developing nation, though she is still far behind in the race of progress and scientific advancement, the fact cannot be denied that Pakistan is now one of the important state of the world.]]></string>
    <string name="c61"><![CDATA[A real friend is hard to find. In fact every body who shakes hands with me or courts me with a smile or an embrace is not a friend in the real sense. He may be merely an acquaintance or sonic thing more. To be a friend there must be present some essential qualities in a person. He must be selfless, sincere and loving. He must never desert his friends under odd circumstances and must be ready to help his friend through thick and thin. He must be very frank and always ready to tell his friend the defects he has.

I am very fortunate to have a real friend at the school. Lean, tall and active, he has a lovely personality and charming manners. He is of my age and the son of a petty shopkeeper. His name is iftikhar. He lives in a modest house not far away from my home.

I have been knowing lftikhar since I was a boy. We had played together as small boys and have begun to like each other since. As fortune may have it we were admitted in the same school and the same class. Known as he was already to mc we cultivated liking for each other and soon became much attached.

Sober, good looking, and energetic, Iftikhar is a little taller than I. He has bright black eyes and a beautifully shaped nose. He is as attractive in his manners as in his appearance. Everyone who meets him desires to make him his friend.

lftikhar is sincere honest and faithful. Always, with a smile on his face and with a charm in his speech, he is ready to help me, to console me, to guide me and to show me the right path. I can never forget those days when I was bedridden due to jaundice and it was he who sat by my bed in a chair talking to me, consoling me, and nursing me. He refused to go home during the days I was ill. His presence was a source of great consolation and hope.

Intelligent, resolute and diligent as lftikhar is, he is one of the most brilliant students of my class. He studies for hours every day and urges me to study with him. He is very good at English and mathematics and helps me a lot in my studies. In fact, it is through his efforts that I have also become a good student.

One of the things, I love Iftikhar for, is his concern for me. If I do some thing wrong he points it out frankly. If I am ever seen with a bad boy, lftikhar takes it seriously and refuses to talk to mc unless I promise not to mix with notorious boys.

Iftikhar is neither proud of his knowledge nor ashamed of his poverty. Poverty, to him, is an outstanding characteristic of the House of our Holy Prophet. He is determined to be a self made man. He is religious and never misses a single prayer even in cold weather. He helps his father in his small business and takes care of his younger brother and sisters. He, sometimes, helps his mother in domestic work. And as far as I am concerned, I wonder what would have become of me without him.]]></string>
    <string name="c63"><![CDATA[Points: Introduction - What I do at home in the morning - School routine - After the school - Conclusion.

I am a student. I lead a disciplined life. Regularity in work has become a habit with me. Hence my daily life follows a very simple routine.

I rise very early in the morning begin my day with my morning prayer. Then I go for a walk in the open fields. There I perform my breathing exercise and take in as much oxygen from the fresh morning air as possible.

On coming back, I take my bath. After my breakfast, I take to studies. I continue reading till 9.30 A.M. Then I prepare myself to go to school. The school begins at 11 A.M. But I am at school at least ten minutes earlier.

On reaching school, I make it a point to occupy one of the seats of the front benches. This I do for two reasons: first, I like to be as near the teacher as possible and secondly, I have known from experience that the back benchers are generally deficient in their studies. We learn various subjects according to the school time-table. I prepare my lessons well everyday. I am always in the good grace of my teachers. The school breaks at 4.P.M.

After school hours I return home at 4.30 P.M. After taking some light refreshment, I go -to the play ground to take part in various games, specially hockey. It refreshes my brain and makes my body active. At about sunset, I get back home. After my evening prayers, I sit down to study and continue upto 8.30 P.M. when I am called to take my supper. After supper, I spend sometime with my brothers and sisters watching T.V. programmes. Very soon sleep overpowers me and I go to bed.

On holidays; I sometimes visit my friends and relatives. Life on holidays will necessarily create a breach of the regular routine. But I never break the golden rule "Early to bed and early to rise."]]></string>

The major disasters concerned here are the occurrences of flood, cyclone and storm surge, flash flood, drought, tornado, riverbank erosion, and landslide. These extreme natural events are termed disasters when they adversely affect the whole environment, including human beings, their shelters, or the resources essential for their livelihoods. The geographical setting of Bangladesh makes the country vulnerable to natural disasters. The mountains and hills bordering almost three-fourths of the country, along with the funnel shaped Bay of Bengal in the south, have made the country a meeting place of life-giving monsoon rains, but also make it subjected to the catastrophic ravages of natural disasters. Its physiography and river morphology also contribute to recurring disasters. Abnormal rainfall and earthquakes in the adjacent Himalayan range add to the disaster situation. Effects of El-Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the apprehended climatic change have a great impact on the overall future disaster scenarios. Since Bangladesh is a disaster prone country, it is subject to colossal damages to life and property almost every year.

Flood is a recurring phenomenon in the country, locally termed as Bonna or Borsha based on the intensity of monsoon rain, magnitude and time of occurrence. When the floodwater damage resources, and disrupt communication and livelihood systems, then it is treated as Bonna. Bangladesh gets damaging floods like that of 1988, which bring untold sufferings to millions of people, and result in human deaths, loss of livestock, spread of diseases and hunger, damaged standing crops, destroyed physical and economic infrastructures, damaged fish and shrimp ponds and hatcheries, etc. Cyclone and storm surges occur frequently and cause significant destruction in the coastal areas of the country. Nor’westers and tornadoes also frequently hit different places. Tropical cyclones and tornadoes uproot trees, telephone, telegraph and electricity lines, destroy bridges, culverts, and houses, kill people and domestic animals, leaving serious and adverse effects on the economy as well as on the whole environment. Although this country with monsoon climate has enough rain, droughts frequently take a significant portion out of the agricultural economy of Bangladesh, and cause hunger, instability, and insecurity. The northwestern part of the country is vulnerable to drought. Disastrous erosions are mainly associated with the major river systems of the country and are seen along these river banks i.e., the Brahmaputra- Jamuna, the Ganges-Padma, the Lower Meghna, and other rivers. The effects of a natural disaster or a combination of more than one natural disaster may be direct loss of life, and certainly damage to physical properties. This requires large resources for disaster management including mitigation, recovery and preparedness. Therefore, the consequences of these natural hazards and the resulting environmental degradation pose a serious threat to the economic development of the country. The situation calls for an effective disaster warning and dissemination system. A timely and accurate alert system about impending disasters will help reduce the loss of life and property (Pramanik, 1991). Natural disasters cannot be prevented, but the damage can be mitigated with adequate planning and adaptation. The impacts of these disasters vary with their type and magnitude. They also critically depend on institutional strength and response by the different agencies that usually take measures to mitigate and eventually overcome the losses, such as the government and other civil service organizations.

It has often been pointed out that the worst disasters in the world tend to occur between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, which is coincidentally the area that contains the poorer countries (Carter, 1991). This applies to Bangladesh where the cause of natural disasters is its geographical setting. The lofty Himalayas in the north, and the funnel-like shape of the Bay of Bengal in the south, have made Bangladesh one of the worst victims of the catastrophic ravages of natural disasters like floods, cyclones, storm surges, droughts, etc. Various anthropogenic activities contribute to worsen the situation. Due to recurring disasters, the country is subject to food shortages in spite of its fertile land, network of rivers, subtropical monsoon climate, and hardworking people. A large part of the population is dependent on agricultural production. But harvesting of produce is often affected by extreme natural events and the weather patterns frequently associated with them.

Bangladesh is a land of many rivers, and heavy monsoon rains. The upstream deforestation, heavy rainfall, melting of glaciers, and soil erosion play a vital role in causing siltation in riverbeds. This in turn leads to natural disasters like floods, flash floods, etc. The upstream activities also enhance the magnitude of damages caused by these disasters. The upstream withdrawal of water due to the Farakka barrage across the Ganges in India leads to local drought conditions in regions of Bangladesh. Bangladesh is the largest delta in the world.

Cyclones can cause immense loss of life and destruction of property during pre-monsoon (April- May), and post-monsoon (October-November.) periods. The Bay of Bengal is the breeding place of catastrophic cyclones. Heavy rains accompanying cyclones, and the tidal waves due to wind effects, called storm surges, cause most of the damages. Storm surge heights are directly related to cyclone intensity. Besides that, coastal configurations and bathymetry are also related to surge heights at the time of cyclone landfall. Astronomical tides in combination with storm surges lead to further amplification of surge heights, resulting in severe flooding.

It is the pre-monsoon period when most of the abnormal rainfall or drought conditions frequently occur in different parts of Bangladesh. Also there are locally severe seasonal storms, popularly known as Nor’westers (Kalbaishakhi). Severe Nor’westers are generally associated with tornadoes. The tornado forms within the Nor’wester, and moves along the direction of the squall of the mother storm.

The north and northeastern parts of Bangladesh are the most active seismic zones, and had experienced earthquakes of moderate to high intensity in the past.

Erosion in Bangladesh is a regular and recurring phenomenon. Erosion of land surfaces, riverbanks, and coastal areas is already causing serious problems for the country. An increase in rainfall in summer is apprehended due to climate change, and this would in turn increase the surface erosion. Land erosion will intensify through current deforestation, and other land use practices.

Natural disasters have a tremendous impact on the overall economy of the country. Apart from the instant impacts, natural disasters can also leave long term impacts.

Almost every year due to natural disasters and climatic hazards, Bangladesh is subject to colossal loss of life and damage of property. All the national planning efforts for development are disrupted by these calamities that leave behind damaged infrastructure facilities, physical assets and land. The human suffering goes beyond description.

It is one of the blessings of the modern civilization. We cannot think of modern life without the newspaper. Man is curious by nature. He wants to know about various events of the world. The newspaper is the best medium to satisfy this curiosity.

The first newspaper was published in China. Venice of Italy was the first place where the first newspaper saw the light of the day in Europe. During the reign of Elizabeth it was published in England. The “Indian Gazette” published in 1774 was the first newspaper in the sub-continent. “The Samachar Darpan” brought out by the Missionaries of Sree Rampur was the first Bengali newspaper.

There are various kinds of newspapers in the world. They are dailies, weeklies, monthlies, fortnightlies, and so on. The daily newspaper carries the various kinds of news and views of the daily affairs of the respective country along with the whole world. So the daily newspaper is popular with all sections of people. Other kinds of newspapers are known as periodicals and magazines. The contain articles, stories, literatures, poems and some other items.

In Bangladesh the Nayadiganta, the Ittefaq, the Amardesh, the Inquilab etc are the important Bengali dailies. The Bangladesh Time and the Bangladesh Observer are prominent English dailies. The Robber, the Bitchitra, the Bartaman Dianka, the Chaya Chhanda etc are the names of weekly magazines. The Chitta Bangla and the Ananda Bichitra are fortnightly and monthly magazine respectively.

Newspaper is very useful to all sections of people. It tells us what is happening at home and abroad. It is said that, Newspapers is a store house of knowledge and information. All sections of people such as Students, Lawyers, Politicians, Traders, and Sportsman etc are always in need of newspapers. They find in the newspaper some items of information that are very useful to them. It familiarizes the students with the world outside. Merchants read the newspaper to know the condition of the market, Lovers of sports go through them to get the sports news, and Politicians come to know the political news of the world. The employment seekers get useful information in it. It is for all these reasons newspapers are a great concern to all. Newspaper is also the best medium of advertisement. Business men bring their products and goods to the notice of a wide circle of people through it. People also express their opinions through newspapers. It is the means of communications between the government and the people.

Newspapers have a great responsibility. Their duty is to lead the people and nation in right way. Hence they should furnish correct news and impartial views. But this is often ignored. As the newspapers are owned by different political parties, they provide news and express views in their own way. Really speaking, newspapers sometimes suppress the truth and spread lies. Hence newspaper is not always an unmixed blessing. Napoleon said, "Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets".

In spite of its draw-backs newspaper is the most useful thing in modern life. We cannot think of a day without it. To read newspaper is a good habit. The more we read newspaper, the more we can acquire knowledge. If we do not read it, we shall be like the frogs in a dark well. It is a looking glass of the modern world. So, all of us should read it regularly.

It has resulted from the circumstances which depict that several other states. A part from the confirmed nuclear power had devised or at least has reached at a point where they are just one screw turn away from having an actual nuclear bomb;

Humanitarian concern argues that acquisition of nuclear weapon is a Domiciles sword on the existence of this world. The devastation that the two world Wars have done is enough to ruin the world and in any case if third world .war took place it would turn this world into a small comets floating in the space with no human inhibition

The concern regarding international power politics is related to the So called nuclear and developed states. They have their own international designs to fulfill. If all the states acquired nuclear bomb, it would obviously undermine their status as super power. Secondly they also assert that some of the states pursuing nuclear proliferation lie in troubled region, surrounded by hostile nations, any conflict among such states would give rise to nuclear war which could become a pretext of third world war.

Regional politics has also done a lot of harm to the developmental process of such nuclear-pursuant states. One such example is India and Pakistan. Both countries are developing nations and they are spending considerable amount of national wealth on the acquisition of nuclear devices, instead of utilizing that money for the eliminations of poverty and unemployment.

The super powers in the cold-war era exerted considerable pressure on the state perusing nuclear weaponry programmed to stop or roll back their efforts coupled with the promises of economic aid and considerable amount of help in perusing nuclear program of civil nature i.e. to enhance the energy producing nuclear plants.

Since then over 150 states acceded to the treaty and ratified the agreements. The NPT expressly stated that nothing in this treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of nuclear development for peaceful purposes.

For first ten to fifteen years this system proved effective with the monitoring capability (granted through the treaty) of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Few states like Brazil and India refused to sign the treaty. They criticized the concept of haves and have-nots in the nuclear proliferation arena. They considered it discriminatory and subjugate efforts on the part of the then super powers, United States and Soviet Union to create a perpetual dominance of these countries on the third world countries.

Nevertheless, considerable number of countries adopted nuclear non-proliferation in the best interest of humanity and their country. But few state, even after ratifying the nuclear proliferation treaty secretly pursued their nuclear program, among such countries were Iraq and North Korea and in addition there remained three major hold outs of the NPT namely India, Pakistan, Israel.

These countries are yet to give any indication to submit to the pressure of United Sates and then developed nations to enter into the domain of nuclear weaponry states. Within the last few years the world has witnessed a culminating danger of nuclear warfare in. the Gulf war crisis and another emerging threat in the Korean peninsula with periodic threats from South Asia region.]]></string>

He is not late at school or college for his lessons. Not late in the playground for his games. If the habit grows well in the time he is never late anything.

An unpunctual boy, on the other hand, is ever late. He attends his school or college late, misses a part of his lesson. Disturbs the class. He can make little progress in students and in the long run to repent for his evil habit.

Punctuality saves time. A train that starts or arrives at the scheduled time or motor service that observes punctuality saves a lot of time and save one from a lot of inconveniences. It known when exactly a steamer will touch at a station one can be their right in time. He has not to miss the steamer or wait indefinitely for its arrival.

An unpunctual man does not serve himself, not he has any consideration of others. It is really ill manners not to meet a friend at the appointed time. It is worse if men, who are address a meeting come late, keeps so many people waiting and waste their times. No excuse is enough for this want of good sense.

Late attendances of employees in an office or in a workshop cause disorder and sometime serious dislocation of work. It hampers orderly progress. It will be no wonder it is ends in some disaster. Napoleon Bonaparte lost the battle of Waterlogged because one of his General failed to come to his help in time.

Punctuality is great necessary in all walks of life. Punctuality should therefore, be cultivated from early age and observed strictly in all affairs of daily life.

    <string name="c75"><![CDATA[Patriotism means the love of own country. It is an inherent quality of very living being. Even the lower animals have some sort of love for their dwelling places. This sentiment is strongest in the nature of man.

If we read history, we find many patriots who suffered great hardship even sacrificed their lives for the freedom of their motherland. Chand Sultana of Ahmadnagar fought against the Mughal Emperor, Akbar. She sacrificed her life for the freedom of her dominion. Joan Arc of France died for the defence of her motherland. Nawab Salimullah, Maulana Muhammad Ali, Maulana Showkat Ali, Shahid Titu Mir, A.K. Fazlul Hoque, Banga Bandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, President Ziaur Rahman and many others have earned immortal names for their self- scarifies for the country. Their names are written in history as the true patriots.

True patriotism is rare. Love for country is nothing but a vain sentiment. It is not translate into action. It is our duty not only to love country, but also to see that we have done something for bettering it. We say that our heart bleeds of the sight of our country’s miseries and misfortune. We sometimes feel really miserable when we think how are she has fallen from her lofty ideals. But many of us do not care to remove the social evils. There is a great need for sincere worker who are ready to sacrifice their comfort, happiness and even their lives for the good of their country.

A patriot’s heart yearns for his homeland, even when he lives a rich foreign land. A patriot lives for his country and dies for his country. His country’s interest is above all his personal interests. He is held in high esteem for his selfless activities and broad mindless. He is prepared to lay down his life for upholding the prestige of his country. A true patriot thinks night and day, for the well-being of his country and countrymen. He is honoured and respected at home and abroad. His activities inspire many others to inculcate patriotism. “Patriotism is a part of religion’, says Islam.

Everyone cannot be an active patriot. But everyone must have love for the land. This does not mean that he should hate other countries. A patriot shall not be a fanatic.

Students have many duties. Among them, their main duty is to study and acquire knowledge. They should be regular in the classes and read their lessons attentively. Besides reading text books, they should read newspapers, magazines, novels, stories etc. which will develop their general knowledge.

They should make the best use of their time; because time and tide wait for none. At this stage, they should build up the habit of practicing honesty, truthfulness, sympathy, generosity and obedience.

Students have some duties to their nation. They may extend their helping hands in the time of any national crisis. During natural calamities they can stand by the suffering people. They can collect funds for helpless people and take part in relief operations. Finally, they should study and work hard for the benefit of the country.

The student should do everything on time and they should not keep any work for tomorrow. They should obey their parents, teachers and seniors. They should good behave with others. They must have good discipline and be co-operative with everyone.

Rice is obtained from paddy. It is a kind of corn. It grows in abundance in hot and moist climate. It is largely found in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Burma, China and Japan.

Rice is of different kinds. They are the Aush, Aman and Boro. The Anon is the best of all paddies grown here. Irri is now available in Bangladesh.

The rice field is first ploughed and then harrowed. Seeds of paddy are then grown in it. The field is weeded several times. This is the process of cultivation of Aush paddy only. The cultivation of Aman paddy requires a process of transplantation. When the rains set in, the cultivator ploughs and harrows his seed plot. He sows paddy there. He keeps the plot moist. After a few days, he gathers the tender seedlings with their roots. He plants them with his hands in his field at a distance. Paddy ripens after four or five months and looks golden and fine.

Paddy is reaped when it is ripen. It is tied up in sheaves and brought to born. The sheaves are then beaten against a long frame made of split of bamboo. The grains are thus separated from the stalks. Paddy is them boiled and sunned and husked. We get rice from it.

rice is our staple food in Bangladesh. Many other kinds of food are made from it. Straw is used as food of the cattle and for other purposes.

About 50% of the people of the world live on rice, so we should take proper steps to grow more rice.

The spring comes after winter and lasts from the middle of February to the end of March. There is life in nature and in man in spring. For this reason I like this season very much.

In winter leaves of trees wither and drop off. Fields become dry and bereft of green. Flowers bloom in abundance. Nature takes a lovely appearance. The earth smiles with beauty. Various kinds of singing birds along with the cuckoo sing in joy. The sky is bright and the peasants are free for their harvest. Their women folk pay visits to the house of their parents after a year. Grown up sons and daughters are wedded in this lovely season. The village children play various games in the paddy field. Elderly people enjoy the might in gossips and games. Jatra, village fairs, cow races, kabigans are held in paddy fields.

Seeds of mustard, Jute, Boro paddy are sown in this season. Sweet fruits are found in plenty. Various kinds of vegetables and fishes sell cheap.

The duration of this season is very short. We hardly perceive when the season disappears. Because of its short stay, everyone longs for the season.

Gentle breeze blows all day long during the season. Little waves in the rivers murmur. Singing birds pour out sweet motes all day long. Bees hum, boatmen and cowboys sing sweet songs. Butterflies dance from flower to flower.

Spring is the most beautiful and loveliest of all the seasons. We should take proper use of this season.

There is state terrorism as well as international terrorism. PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and IRA (Autonomy for Republic of Ireland) seek to terrorism in order to press their political demands. There may be state terrorism too, done by the police force, as Hitler’s police force. The Sarbahara Party in Bangladesh is a political terrorist group.

All the campuses in Bangladesh are mow rife with terrorist activities. Students from rival parties clash daily and kill one another. Brawn has taken over brain in the campus. The very image of education is desecrated.

the youths are victims of terrorism. They do the killing as well as get killed. Their leader remains in the background safe.

The main cause of terrorism is the undemocratic culture of politics. Most political parties both the ruling and the opposition parties are all engaged in a violent game of politics. The educational institutions are occupied by armed cadres and bodies fall by bullets everywhere.

The economic conditions of the people should be improved. New jobs should be created so that young people do not have to do terrorism for money. The judiciary and the police should act neutrally in taking action against terrorism. In general, the political parties gas to hold the key to solve the problem.

Terrorism has mot an end. But it can be controlled. The youths are like clay. They should not be moulded in the wrong way by the guardians of the society. Now it is our main duty to save them.

Traffic jams occur due to lack of knowledge about the traffic rules of the drivers. The other major cause of traffic jams originates in the movement of rickshaws and carts on the main road. In the pictures about traffic jams printed in newspapers more rickshaws and carts are seen than motor vehicles. Over the years more vehicles have come out than there are roads for them move. Most of the roads in the older parts of major cities are narrow and the streets recently made prove to be not very wide either.

The WASA, T&T, PDB, and gas systems organizations can be seen engaged in digging the roads throughout the year. Their activities create traffic jams all the year round. The footpath vendors are really the indirect culprits for causing the traffic jam. They erect stalls just on the footpath pushing the pedestrians out into the road that in their turn block the free passing of traffic. Political meetings and rallies frequently create traffic jams. It is strange to note that all major political parties do not hesitate to hold public meetings just on the streets. They receive much silent curse from the journey-hampered people. Though, recently, the government is trying to impose a law banning political meetings in the streets.

The steps that have to be taken for controlling the traffic are to educate the drivers about the traffic rules, get the road wider, make by-passes and remove the footpath shopkeepers. The traffic police also have to be posted at more places for effective controlling of traffic.

Training in practical art and science is called technical education. It means learning a particular art or science or craft by actual doing. No training is complete without scientific knowledge.

No nation can prosper without a large number of technically qualified men. Shortage of technical is hampering our industries. So, large scale technical education is necessary for greater production of our industries. Therefore, without technical education no nation can prosper lavishly.

There are various kinds of technical education like engineering, commercial, medical, agriculture, industrial; mining etc. the branches of technical education should be extended largely to assist the vagabond people. It provides employment to a good number of citizens.

Bangladesh needs industrial revolution. But Bangladesh is not advance in it. She needs hundreds of technicians now and will need more in the near future. At present here technical man-power is supplied by foreign countries. But this state of things has to be stopped. Today or tomorrow industries are to be managed and run by our own people. Our government has paid attention to this matter.

The importance of technical education is very great. This education solves the problem of unemployment. Technically educated people can at least earn their even bread in honest and honourable way. Mainly, it develops our country. It makes the self-sufficient economically. It goes a long way in creating rapid industrialization.

If we give priority to the technical education we may have a bright future. The teaching of technical subject’s right form the secondary stage must be stressed and recognized. If we are technically developed, we will be prosperous as a nation.

But now it can move and talk. So, it is called “The Talkies”. Tomas Alva Addison invented the projector in 1890. That was like a camera.

With the help of powerful cameras-pictures of moving and talking persons are taken on the film. These pictures are developed. When these pictures are projected on a screen the persons seem to move and talk as they did before.

Cinema is kind of source of amusement. Busy people of the town refresh themselves in a cinema show after the day’s hard work. It has an educative value. Cinema can teach us history, geography, sociology, literature and even medical science. The best books of best writers are filmed and show to people and they learn much from them. Through film-industry some people earn a lot of money. A good cinema film can earn fame and foreign currency for the country. A good cinema also reforms the society.

For commercial purposes bad pictures are made. These are very harmful to teen agers and become menace to society. Mainly, who are not adult in mentally they should not see the cinema.

While making a film one producer must be conscious about this duty to the country. He must make a film that can primarily educate and reformate the spectator and earn money. Otherwise, the cinema will be the foe of the country.

There are a good arrangement of car parking, sanitation, praying and all other comforts and enjoyments. Tea stalls, fast food shops, restaurants, moving cars of cold drinks are available there.

A trade fair is of great importance. All these enable the people, not only to improve their own lot but also to contribute to the property of their country. It has a great educative value also. The knowledge and culture of other countries come to us as well as we can also represent it to them. It is a source of amusement and refreshment too.

A trade fair is a good media for advertisement, better than that through papers. Undoubtedly a practical demonstration. Of thing is more affective to make things impressive. So trade fair should be organized every year for the social as well as economical welfare of country.

    <string name="c91"><![CDATA[Bangladesh is mainly called a land of rivers. A network of rivers spread over it like the network of artery in human body and carried water to the remotest parts of the land. The three principal rivers of Bangladesh are the Padma, the Meghna and the Jamuna and many of the other rivers are their tributaries. They have tributaries as well. These rivers run into the mighty rivers and feed them.

Bangladesh is a vast of alluvial deposit. It is so because of these rivers. With the exception of a few tracts of land, the whole of Bangladesh is deltaic region made of the alluvial deposits felt by these rivers.

Bangladesh is remarkable for is its fertile soil. For this, too, it is indebted to its rivers. The mighty rivers of Bangladesh carry an enormous amount of mud into the country every year and the monsoon floods take it to all the parts that are inundated during the wet months. When the water recedes, there lies a thick layer of mud deposit of silt. This adds greatly to the fertility to the soil.

These Rivers as good water ways as well and help trade and commerce in a big way. Boats, launches and steamers carry more passengers and goods than trains, trucks and buses. Therefore, these rivers as an important means of transport also and they reach almost all the parts of the country.

Fish is an important wealth of Bangladesh of the great rivers is great storehouses of fish. A large bulk of the fish we need comes from these rivers. Quite a lot of people live by fish. A large number of them are prosperous.

Sometimes these rivers bring flood. Large volumes of water come from the upper reaches of the great rivers and rivers overflow their bands and submerge large areas, causing heavy damage to standing crops. In consequence, famine follows. These rivers then with turn out to be a source of sorrow and suffering.

Bangladesh lost her independence to the British when Nawab Serajuddola was defeated in the battle of Palassey in 1757. In 1947, the British divided India into two sovereign states, India and Pakistan. Pakistan was created but the people of Bangladesh were in majority in Pakistan, They were deprived of all the powers Bangladesh was made o colony of West Pakistan. As a result the people of Bangladesh could not tolerate this and started a strong movement for their release.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and some patriot of Bangladesh raised their voice of protest. In 1968, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and some other Bengalese were charged with a false case known as Agartola Conspiracy Case, but the people of Bangladesh started a strong movement against this case. Ayub Khan was compelled to release them. Then came Yahia Khan and he declared general election in 1970. The party of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman got absolute majority in the National assembly. But Yahia did not hand over the power and he stopped National Assembly. As a result, Sheikh Mujib started non-violent, non-co-operation movement. Yahia started a false dialogue with Sheikh Mujib and he began to increase the strength of army.

March 25 is a black day in the history of Bangladesh. On that night the army began to attack in the unarmed people of Bangladesh. Sheik Mujib was arrested and taken to West Pakistan. The independence of Bangladesh was declared. As the liberation war started, freedom fighters took birth overnight and faced the well-trained occupying forces to Pakistan fearlessly. At Mujib Nagar the government of the people republic of Bangladesh was formed on 17th April, 1971. But the Pakistan went on committing genocide to horror of the world. Women were raped and killed. The world press believed the atrocity of the of the occupying forces exceeded all limits. Millions of innocent Bengalese fled across the border in fear of their loves. So when their crimes were full, the Pakistanis came under direct attack of the combined forces of India and Bangladesh. The 16th December: The final stage of the war took a couple of days only. On the glorious day of 16th December, the Pakistani army surrendered. Our victory day confirmed the birth of Bangladesh on the world map.

Though we achieved our independence through much bloodshed, we still are not emerging as a powerful nation. We seem to have forgotten the supreme sacrifice we made in 1971. So our main duty should be to build up the country.

He brings us news from our near and dear ones living at distant places. He is known to all sections of people for his services. Even children can instantly know him when he knocks at the door.

His dress: A post man is known to us all for his traditional uniform and dress. He generally wears a khaki uniform supplied by the postal department. He always carried a bag on his shoulder containing letters, money orders, parcels and other postal articles for delivery. He is seen to carry an umbrella over his head during rains and the summer.

His duties: The post man performs a lot of duties. His daily work begins in the post offices with the sorting of letters, parcels, money orders etc. After collecting letters, parcels, money order etc. from the post office he goes out on his beat. The post man in a town goes house to house to deliver them. He generally drops the letter in the private letter boxes. Where there is no letter box he drops the letters through some opening of the doors.

A village post man goes on his beat twice or thrice a week. Sometimes he is seen to use a bicycle. He comes to the market place on hat day and delivers letters, parcels, money orders etc., to their addresses. He delivers everything to the addresses with great care.

Qualities of a good postman: A postman should have some good qualities. He must be punctual, dutiful, sincere, honest and hard-working. He is a good man and good friend to us indeed. He never neglects his duties though he is ill-paid, ill-clad. In all weather, whether good or inclement he performs his duties sincerely.

We always hope that he will bring some good news, and we eagerly wait for him. Sometimes he brings bad news and makes us unhappy and sad. But when he brings good news our heart fills with pleasure and joy. This is why the post man is always welcomed by all. It reminds us the rhyme:-

Pass the letter over the gate."

Conclusion: A post man is a very useful person to us. We cannot thing a civilized society without his services. He performs the most responsible job in the society.

Carbon dioxide makes our atmosphere or rather our environment poisonous for us. Trees consume this carbon dioxide and thereby make our environment safe for us.

Trees also give us many other benefits. We get fruit and flowers from the trees. Trees provide us with fuel and timbers. In summer, they bear the scorching rays of the sun and give us cool shade under them. Trees in our forests draw the rain from the clouds floating in the sky. Trees in our forests check the quick flow of rain-water and thereby check the occurrence of high flood in our rivers. On the other hand, this slow process of water-flow gives us good water all throughout the year through streams and streamlets with their sweet melodious music.

Trees conserve our soil. This soil-conservation is very important for our corn-fields. Trees make own land fertile by their fallen leaves. By their fallen leaves they make new soil for us. Most of the forest-products are the products from the trees in the forests, absentee of trees will cause a lot of harm to us and to our life. So the number of trees should be multiplied by the tree-plantation by us.

We should plant trees near our houses and near our villages for a forestation with a view to raising new forests. We should plant trees on the two sides of the roads and paths and on the four sides of our corn-fields. We should plant trees on all the vacant places in our village on towns where we live, and we should advise all to do so.

We should make good selection of trees to be planted, in consideration of the nature of land and the kind of climate. Coconut trees grow well in the sea-coasts. Plantain trees grow well near the ponds. We should know which place is fit for which tree. To know this we should get our soil tested by the experts and plant the kinds of trees accordingly. Collection of plants to be planted should be made from the Government nurseries in consultation with the experts there.

Generally, rainy season is the best time for tree-plantation. Most of the tree-plants thrive well in rainy season. Still then, we should seek advice from the Government agricultural experts about the appropriate time for the plantation of a particular kind of tree.

Only planting the trees is not enough. Because, planted trees may be destroyed by animals or otherwise, or may die for regular service of water. So we should be particular about the after-care of the planted trees. We should be very careful about the newly-planted trees.

Trees should be regularly planted to save the mankind and the animal world. Tree plantation and its after-care is a pleasing work too. We can get much pleasure in planting trees and in taking care of them. Students should plant trees in their school-compounds and in the front-yards, backyards and side-yards of their schools and near their own houses and in other places wherever possible. They should explain to their neighbors the goodness of tree-plantation and encourage them to plant and care new trees.

    <string name="c95"><![CDATA[Bangladesh is a land of natural beauty. Her beauty varies from season to season. She has six seasons. Each season has its own features. We hear new sounds and enjoy new scenes in each season. Nowhere in the world are the six seasons so sharply felt as in Bangladesh. Everything changes and people also feel different in each season. They forget the monotony of life and start their daily work anew.

Of the six seasons of the Bengali year, I like the rainy season most. "Ashar" and "Sraban' are the months of the rainy season in Bangladesh. But sometimes this season lasts upto 'Ashwin'. Though the rainy season has some disadvantages, I like the rainy season most because it makes our land fertile and environment green.

The rainy season is caused by monsoon. The south-west monsoon that blows over Bangladesh from the Bay of Bengal brings the rains. The south-west monsoon blows along with maximum water-vapor. This vapor is cooled when it comes in contact with the cool air above. This cold vapor is then condensed into cloud and causes rains.

During the rainy season, the weather remains dull. The sky remains covered with thick clouds. Sometimes the sum is not seen. During this time it rains cats and dogs. Sometimes rains continue for days together. As a result, rivers, ponds, tanks, canals are full to the brim. Sometimes gusty winds blow accompanied with the flashes of lighting and the roars of thunder. Fields go under water.

I like this season for the following conditions: After the severe hot days of summer, the rainy season comes with its refreshing showers to cool the heated nature. Green leaves are seen here and there. The brown and cracked fields of summer get a magical change. The meadows are carpeted with soft green. The cattle graze happily all day long.

The rainy season is of great advantages. Current of rain water carries silt which makes our field fertile. Bangladesh is an agricultural country and most of the crops are dependent on the rain water. It helps to grow paddy, jute, sugarcane, tea and many other seasonal crops.

In this season tiny meadow flowers blossom in clusters everywhere. So the heart of a poet often leaps up with joy at the sight of the natural beauty of this season. He becomes inspired to portray the beauty of this season in his poetic works. It also helps the fairy minded people and novelists also. Rain washes away the filth and dirt from the earth's surface. It also purifies the atmosphere.

During the rainy season fishes are found in plenty in rivers, canals and ponds. Sometimes fishes are found in men's yard. Children are cheered up to catch fishes. The fishermen have plenty of fishes and earn their bread well. To them, the rainy season is a boon.

In this season fairy men are going to take journey by boat. Men can easily go from one place to another by boat and enjoy it most.

The rainy season is not free from disadvantages. It is a curse to the poor shelterless people. Due to excessive rainfall, the country roads become muddy and slippery. The urban roads often become impassable. Moreover, much rainfall causes flood in whole areas, which damages our crops. These floods cause terrible havoc. Men and cattle are washed away; the houses, roads, bridges and railway lines go under water. In fact, the floods cut off the whole area from the outside world for days together, and are often followed by famine and pestilence. It is the season of influenza and dysentery.

Bangladesh is an agro-based country. So here, the importance of the rainy season is undeniable. From this point of view, it is a blessing to Bangladesh. In fact, in the rainy season, people suffer a lot in many ways. But its economic value is very great. However, with all its demerits is still a blessing and I favor it most.

    <string name="c85"><![CDATA[Television is one of the most important and remarkable gifts of modern science. Its invention has brought about a great change in the communication system between the countries of the world.

The German scientist Paul Nipkow first thought of sending image to a distant place. Persistent efforts made by the scientists and the continued experiments ultimately resulted in the invention of television in 1926. It was first invented by the renowned British Scientist J.L. Baird.

Television has become the most popular means of communication and a source of recreation. As the price of television has come within the reach of the middle and lower middle class families, television has gained popularity with the people of all walks of life. In the city areas, poor people are found gathering at the shops selling television sets. It clearly indicates how popular television is at the grassroots level.

Television is the best medium of communication. It provides us with the day-to-day news at home and abroad. It delights and instructs us in various ways. Dramas, sports, film-shows, cinemas and many other important events are screened on it. We can enjoy them sitting in our drawing room.

After days hard work, we sit before a television set that presents some beautiful and enjoyable programs. It has enabled us to watch and enjoy games and sports like football, cricket, tennis, etc., held in different parts of the world. It also cheers us with its musical programs.

Television is also one of the best media of advertisements. Information about new products and services reach millions of people in a few seconds by means of television. Through television, political leaders can make people aware of their programs and can form their opinions.

But television has got its dark sides also. Sometimes students prefer enjoying TV to studying. They spend their valuable study hours by watching TV programs. Besides, television leaves a great influence on the Juvenile mind. Some of the programs and film shows are not always suitable for the whole family. Sometimes, obscene films and almost naked female figures are shown on television. Young people especially the students are easily affected by these sorts of scenes.

Television is a wonderful invention of modern science. It is the best medium of communication and an excellent means of recreation. It plays a vital role in our day-to-day life. It is used for the well-being of the people with greater and greater success. With a careful selection of the programs, people can derive great benefit from television.

    <string name="c98"><![CDATA[Time is the most valuable thing in our life. It is more valuable than health and wealth. Our life is made of moments and hours. So to kill time is shorten life.

Time and tide wait for none. Once passed they never come back. But they differ from each other too. Time does not follow in vain. It makes the land fertile when it passes away. Time, if it is wasted makes our life barren and if utilized, it makes us happy.

Success in life depends on the right use of time. Our life is very short. But within this short time we have to do various duties. So we must be punctual. There should be time for reading, time for play, time for other works, time for rest and time for prayer. All the great men make right use of time. Even the lower animals like bees and ants make proper use of time.

Those who waste time can never prosper in life. Idleness is the roof of all evils. An idle man cannot earn his living. He must not defer a work for tomorrow and it never done. Moreover, an idle brain is the devil’s workshop.

The benefits of time are too many. So we should make proper use of time. We must not defer anything for future date.

My dear friend Sharin,
I have not heard from you for a long time. Hope you are keeping well. You know that our Annual/SSC examination is near at hand. I am busy with my studies. I can guess that you are also busy with your studies. I am sorry to tell you that I am at present badly in need of the book, which you borrowed from me last month. How ever today I like to remind you that a few days ago you borrowed my English grammar. But it is now over a month. Perhaps, you have forgotten it. Now I need this book for preparation. So, I shall be highly thankful if you please return it as early as possible. If you need it again, I will give it to you after examination. I hope you will not misunderstand me for this.
No more today.

Your ever,

At first take my compliments and love. I think you are well with the grace the almighty. A am also well. So, far as I know you are not so good in English, which is the international language. I am going to advise how you can improve your skill. English is used and understood in almost all over the countries. If you wish to have higher education in any subject you must know English. So try hard to improve your English.
By listening, speaking and reading books you can improve your English. I advise you to read English newspaper and listen to English news bulletin regularly. Read English story books and novels. Keep a notebook and write down every new word you come across. Then write down its meaning consulting dictionary. And finally try to speak English as much as you can. If you follow these instructions you will surely improve.

Yours truly,

By this time you must know how to use a computer. Using the Internet takes nothing more than the ability to use a computer. For using Internet you have to use the particular software.
If you click on the icon of browsing software such as the Microsoft Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you will automatically get logged on the Internet. You will find a space for writing the address of the web page you want to see. If you write the address, you will get to see that page. For finding a particular page you can take the help of search engine through which you can search for information on web pages. Yahoo and MSN and Google are the such engines.

At the beginning of the letter, take my cordial love. I am sorry that you have been addicted to smoking.You know that smoking is a bad habit. It does a lot of harm to us. A single puff of cigarette smoke contains 15 billion particles of substances which are very dangerous for health. Smoking causes cancer,heart attack and other fatal diseases. Excessive smoking may lead a person for premature death.
I would suggest you to give up smoking just now. Firm determination of mind will help you in this respect. Never indulge in such dangerous habit again.

Your letter of the 5th instant in to hand. In your letter you wrote about communicative English. In the letter you have asked me to write about the advantages of it. Now I am writing about it. Communicative English in a newly introduced English learning method through which one can communicate with other easily. Actually it is the purpose of any language. The method has some advantages. In the communicative method at dents understanding power can be tasted more then the previous method. When a student fails to understand seen or unseen comprehension, he will be unable to answer the question that follow. A student has to fill in the gaps of cloze test from his understanding taking word from his vocabulary. In the previous course we got the letters and applications by heart. But in communicative English their situations are not common. While writing we have to add something. It increases our creative power. It encourages us to write free hand. In true sense it is the ultimate goal of any language learning. So the importance of communicative English can never be denied.

No more today. Meet when our meeting will be held again . With best regards to your parents and love to you and all . hoping to have a few lines from you in reply.

Words can hardly give vent to the rude shock the news of your mother’s death gave me. It came to me like a bolt from the blue. I cannot believe my ears till now. It is so sudden and yet so real. The other day I found her quite hale and hearty. Her sad demise is an immeasurable personal loss to me. She was to me like my own mother. I cannot forget her filial love and affection for me. Still it is inevitable and common to all. May God keep her soul rest in eternal peace. Words of consolation will fall flat to you, I know. I am only thinking of your father who loved her with all his heart. I request you not to brood over your personal bereavement. Time will change everything. Please take heart to go ahead. I’ll meet you soon.

I am really worried to learn from mother that you are spending much time on sports neglecting your studies. Don’t forgot that your first and foremost duty as a student is to study. This does not at all mean that I ask you not to take part in sports. In fact, I advise you to make a balance between studies and games. Your final examination is ahead. I expect good result from you that will ensure you a good career. But without hard work, no success is possible, you know very well. So I shall ask you to study hard in real interest without further delay to shine in life. No more for the time being. Don’t forget to send the report of your progress in the final exam.

The result of first Unit Test has just been out. I have secured an average of 77% marks in every subject. But I have not at all done well in Mathematics. I have got only 55 in it. It is a very poor mark indeed at par with the marks in other subjects. I have already approached the teachers of Mathematics of my school for their valuable advice. They have advised me to practise from Test Papers by ABTA and Objective Mathematics by Jana and Mitra. So as the cost of the two books, I badly need Rs. 200/- now. Please remit me the amount by money order as early as possible. I hope everyone at home is in good health.

I received your letter in time. Thank you very much for your encouragement and best wishes for my examination. Now that my examination is over, I feel more relaxed. In your letter you wanted to know about my English Examination. Let me tell you about it.

Our English teaching and learning process has undergone a thorough change in 2001. Last year the English question on the new curriculum has been introduced in the Madhyamik Examination. Anyway, there are three sections in our English question paper. The first section is called Reading Comprehension (Seen and Unseen), the second one is called Grammar and Vocabulary and the third section is called Writing. Of all these I like Reading Comprehension and Grammar and Vocabulary sections. I find Writing section a little difficult. In this examination I have fared well in the first two sections as I expected but I could not do so well in the third section. However, the question paper was neither too difficult nor too easy.

How was your examination? Do drop me a few lines by return of post. Awaiting your reply. With lots of love.

Your sever,
Sumya Rahman]]></string>

Your sweet note is just to hand. I am glad that you have enjoyed yourself very much in the ‘Poushmela’ of Santiniketan.

I have never been to Santiniketan. But once I went to ‘Pir Gorachander Mela, a fair held at Deganga in the North 24 Parganas in honour of a Muslim saint. My father took me there. The fair ground is located on the bank of the Vidyadhari centring a holy mosque. This fair is important for its spirit of religious tolerance and integrity.People from both Hindu and Muslim communities have been taking part in it for centuries. It is also famous for folk singers who assemble here during the fair. I enjoyed my visit to the fair very much. The usual shops in the fair and the huge crowd were also interesting. Before coming back home, I ate very tasteful hot ‘Jilipi’ to my heart’s content.

I take leave here. With lots of love and best wishes.

You will be glad to learn that we had had a grand time at the Alipore Zoo last Sunday. To get entry, we stood in a long queue and collected tickets. First we saw a huge multi-coloured migratory birds chirping and flying here and there in the cage and in the large tank. We saw monkeys, apes, peacocks, zebras, deer, giraffes, camels, leopards and many other animals. We fed bananas, vetch, nut and biscuits to some animals. Next we went a hippopotamus in a shallow pond. We had a great fun to see a chimpanjee smoking a cigarette sitting on a chair. The roar of the lions in the cages made us afraid. Finally the Royal Bengal Tigers walking up and down and roaring in the cages captivated all of us. It was a great experience indeed. It is still fresh in my memory.

No more for the time being. More when we meet next. With lots of love.

My Dear,
I am very glad to know that you have got high marks in the Exams. I am informed that you were over absorbed in your studies and do not care for your health. It is not good.
Dear brother, you should know that only a sound body has a sound mind. Try to sleep early. Go outside for a morning walk. You should have light exercises in the morning also. If you keep on reading without taking any exercise, your health will soon break down. I think you will give proper attention to my advises. I am waiting for a good report from you.

Sir,
Through the column of your esteemed paper, I want to draw the attention of the higher officials of the education department and the parents to the grave problems of smoking among students. Smoking in its different forms, has become a favourite hobby of most of the students. The number of such students is increasing day by day. Now ever the young students studying in primary and high schools are taking to this hazardous habit.
Girls, too, are not exception,. At first students adopt this habit as fashion after getting allured by the t.v commercials. Later on they get addicted to it. Every body knows that smoking is injurious to health. Smokers suffer from such fatal diseases as cancer, t.b and hert attack. It is also the sheer waste of money. Students spend their parent’s hard earned money on thes damaging hgabit.
It is the duyty of the parents to keep a vigilant eye on their children’s and sees in whose company they spend their time. Teachers should also realize their duty. They should themselves avoid smoking before the students. Special lectures to explain the devastating effects of smoking are arranged regularly. No teacher or student should bne allowed to smoke in the college primises.
I hope that both teachers and parents will take some drastic measures to check this trend among the students.

Yours truly,y

Dear Sir,
The city district government has developed Chittagong by making roads and parks in the whole city.
However, it is a pity that they start digging the roads over a wide area all at once. The roads become unusable. It causes great inconvenience to people.
The city government should make a wise plan for the city. The making of new roads and the breaking of old roads should be systematic. This is not a wise strategy to leave a vast area in a dilapidated condition for a long time. Sometimes it takes years to build roads.
The concerned authorities should look into the matter and save people from the inconvenience.

Sir,
Through the column of your esteemed paper, I want to draw the attention of the higher authorities to the bane of beggary that is fast creating problems in the busy streets and markets of our city. All public places, roads and markets are thronged with different type of beggars. They include young and old men and women, small boys and girls, blind and lame. At every traffic signal they rushed towards the cars and try to fleece money using different tactics from the passengers. They distract the attention of there drivers and thus cause accidents. Some of the beggars are so horribly mutilated and diseased that children get scared to see them. It has a negative effect on their psyche. Most of these beggars are criminals. Beggar women and children sneak in the crowded places and steal people’s purse, mobiles and other valuables.
Islam discourages begging. It is the duty of the state to provide basic necessities of life to its citizens. It should take immediate measures to rehabilitees old and handicapped beggars provide jobs to the young boys and girls and send small children to school.

The pollution in our city is increasing at a very fast rate. As a result people are affecting from it. People are suffering from diseases. They are becoming irritable. It is affecting them seriously. The pollution is a danger to health.
Nobody seems to be aware of the problems of pollution in the city. The city government is mainly responsible for keeping the city clean and pollution free. They can plant more trees on the sides and the centre of roads and cities. They can stop vehicles that emit smoke. They can improve the cleanliness of the city.

Dear Sir,
The corruption has reached its height in our country. People are not even able to buy genuine drugs and medicines. Patients buy medicines at high prices so that they can recover health. The medicines they take are not able to cure them of their diseases because they are bogus. Even the life saving drugs are not genuine. It is a crime equivalent to killing people. Those who are dealing in such fake drugs and those who are responsible for spreading this practice need to be punished severely. Their punishment should be exemplary so that nobody could even think of doing so.
The concerned authorities should take immediate steps against those who are selling such drugs and give them severe punishment.

Sir,
Through the columns of your esteemed paper P wish to draw the attention of the Health Department, Government, of Pakistan, to the sorry state of affairs in the Civil Hospital of this town.
This is a town with a very large population which is always on the increase. But, unfortunately, the facilities in the Hospital are vanishing day by day. Firstly, the building in itself is inadequate, very old and dilapidated. The family ward, especially, is in a poor condition.
Secondly, those at the helm of affairs are negligent and indifferent to the public. They generally treat the people as if they were animals. Only those who are influential or who can offer some ‘tip’ are entertained. Then the conditions are very unhygienic: cleanliness is not maintained. The staff lacks the sense of duty.
I request the Director of Health or, some other responsible official to pay a surprise visit to this hospital and see for himself the state of affairs. When the contents of this letter are verified it may be hoped that the helpless people of this town will get deliverance from these difficulties.

Yours truly,

Dear Aftab,
Thank you very much for your invitation to your birthday party. Of course. I shall be present.
It has been a quite a while since all our common friends met both of us together- I think the last time this happened was five years ago when all of you came to see me off, en route to Lahore. Even since I returned from Lahore I have been too busy to renew all the old contacts, or to make new ones, Your birthday party is, therefore, a God-sent boon to me; it will give me a much sought-after opportunity to meet all of you, under one roof at the same time, The other day I met Mr. Khalid, our common friend of the primary school days. He walked up to me with a broad smile and a hand extended for a big shake. I did shake his hand, but failed to return his smile or respond to the warmth of his handshake. He guessed that I had not recognized him, and introduced himself. We had a really hearty laugh at the incident. So I am afraid you wiU have to point out many of the guests to me, in advance, lest I should confuse them with one another.
Your party promises to be a great occasion, indeed. The long spell of games and dancing after the sumptuous dinner that you are giving will be remembered for a long time to come. I am glad too, that your brother, who has recently returned from Islamabad, will contribute some new games. If time permits. I shall also contribute some items. I have heard much in praise of your uncle as a master of ceremonies, and his willingness to officiate at the party will, I am sure, add to its grandeur.
During my long absence from his country, I seldom had a chance to cook, and I have in fact, forgotten much of the cooking I knew when I left for Lahore, All the same, I shall help n cooking whatever dishes I can. I will be with you as early as possible in the morning of the 2O’, and accompany you to market. If you can got enough people to help with the cutting and peeling of vegetables, it will not take very long to cook them.
My parents, brother, and sisters send you their congratulations in advance, and have promised to confirm these with a handsome gift. Which I shall bring with me, In spite of your warning that no gifts shall be accepted.

 Mahir : Oh, no I do not feel comfort in Dhaka city. It’s totally boring.

 Sayed : What are the things of city life you do not like?

 Mahir : I think life in the city is very artificial. It’s full of business and separation. People lead a very busy life in polluted area. They wake up from sleep in the morning hearing the sounds of motor vehicles, machines and factories.

 Sayed : You are right. But there are many modern facilities you can have in city life. In cities there are many good educational institutions, hospitals and clinics. There’re also many recreational places in the city. It’s often easier to find work here.

 Mahir : That’s true, but I think life in the village is far better than of city life. Village life is quite natural and the people in the village lead a very simple life. They wake up from sleep in the morning hearing the melodious songs birds. They can take fresh food, fruits, fishes, meat and vegetable. Similarly, the villagers are cooperative as well as helpful. The environment of the village is totally pollution free. You can get the scenery of green field and meadows.

 Sayed : But village life is not without its disadvantages. Disease, hunger malnutrition poverty is common in the life of the villagers.

 Mahir : Actually both the lives have their advantages and disadvantages. A balanced development can remove the gap between two types of life.

 Sayed : I agree with you.

 Mahir : Thanks a lot and you are highly invited in our village.

 Sayed : Oh sure. I hope I will visit your house during the next holiday. Good- bye.

 Sakib : Yes, of curse. It’s the key factor. Our government has already taken some steps to remove illiteracy.

 Monir : We must co-operate with the govt.

 Sakib : Yes, we must come forward in this regard.

 Monir : But there are some people in our society who are very poor. They are unwilling to send their children to school owing to poverty.

Sir,
 With due respect and humble submission I beg to state that I am a student of class IX of your School. I have been reading in this for the last four years. Since my admission in this institution I showed excellent performances in academic affairs. All along, I stood first in the class. This year also I stood first obtaining 90% marks.It is to be noted here that my father who was a Government employee, has recently retired from his job. Now he has no source of income other than some landed property. So, it is not possible for him to defray my educational expenses after maintaining a large family consisting of seven members.Now, if I am not favoured with a full free student-ship from the School I fear, I will have to put an end to my studies which will shatter all my future hopes and aspirations.
In this circumstances, I fervently pray and hope that you would be kind enough to grant me a full- free student-ship from this month so that I may continue my studies further.Should you be kind enough to grand my prayer, I would spare no pains to prove myself worthy of your favor.

Sir,
 We, on behalf of the people of the village Palash, would like to draw your kind attention to the acute scarcity of pure drinking water in our village. The few tanks in the village that are used to supply pure water have already dried up on account of severe drought. There are, of course, three tube-wells in the village. Two of them again have gone out of order. The remaining one is, therefore, unable to supply drinking water for nearly 250 families that live in the village. And as such the villagers have been suffering a lot for want of pure drinking water. In absence of pure drinking water they often drink unclean water and suffer from diseased link diarrhea, dysentery etc. Hence sinking of, at least, two tube-wells in the central part of the village have become essential to remove the long left want for pure drinking water.
In view of the circumstances, we earnestly pray and hope that you would kindly take immediate steps to skink at least two tube-wells in the middle of the village to ensure the supply of pure drinking water to the villagers. For this act of your kindness we shall remain ever grateful to you.

Every time the experienced fisherman caught a big fish, he put it in his ice chest to keep it fresh. Whenever the inexperienced fisherman caught a big fish, he threw it back. The experienced fisherman watched this go on all day and finally got tired of seeing the man waste good fish. “Why do you keep throwing back all the big fish you catch?” he asked. The inexperienced fisherman replied, “I only have a small frying pan.” Sometimes, like that fisherman, we throw back the big plans, big dreams, big jobs, big opportunities that God gives us. Our faith is too small. We laugh at that fisherman who didn’t figure out that all he needed was a bigger frying pan, yet how ready are we to increase the size of our faith? Whether it’s a problem or a possibility, God will never give you anything bigger than you can handle. That means we can confidently walk into anything God brings our way. REMEMBER: Stop telling God you’ve got big problems. Tell your problems you’ve got a BIG GOD!]]></string>

It bears no fruit at all.” The tree felt pinched to hear the traveller’s words and burst out “You ungrateful soul ! you are taking shelter in my cool shade from the burning heat of the sun and calling me a useless tree as well. Can there be a more wicked creature than you on this earth ? Be up and leave the place at once to be scorched again.” Ingratitude earns others’ wrath.]]></string>

They laid a bet. Each of them claimed that his balloon would go the highest in the sky. Addy purchased a blue colour balloon, thinking that it would travel the highest, since the sky was also blue. At a given signal, each of them let go of their balloons. All the balloons started going up in the sky. But Addy was disappointed to see that his balloon did not go the highest.

On the third day, the children were playing the same game. Addy badly wanted to win this time. But he was confused. He didn’t know what colour of balloon to purchase. He didn’t know which would go highest. Addy was puzzled; he approached the balloon seller. Unable to decide, Addy asked the balloon seller, “Tell me please, which balloon will go the highest in the sky? Is it the red, the yellow, the green or the blue one?” The balloon seller smiled at Addy and said, “My dear child! It is not the colour of the balloon that decides how high it will go in the sky. What matters the most is what the balloon has inside it. The balloon, which is filled with more gas, and that too with the lightest gas, rises the highest.” The balloon seller then gave Addy the balloon that had more gas than the other balloons.

Occasionally, he would break his leg or hurt himself on account of his foolish deeds. One day, Alas pierced needles in both his eyes. As a result he became blind and was unable to see anything around. Soon he realized that he had once again performed a foolish act. He was now afraid that people would laugh at him and ridicule his folly. His mind began churning — “What shall I tell other people?” Very soon, he got an idea.
Next morning, unable to see anything, he was passing through the lanes holding a stick in his hand. Suddenly he was surrounded by a lot of people. ‘Alas, what happened, what happened?” everyone was questioning him.
An old person asked him, ‘Alas, have you become blind? Why are you moving with a stick in your hand?”
Alas, who was ready to answer the question, replied, “Oh, you see, I pierced needles in my eyes. It is not that I have become blind; now I can see the Heavens.”
“The Heavens? Now how is that possible,” asked someone from the crowd.
“Yes, I can see the Heavens now! Piercing needles through my eyes has given me that power,” came the reply from Alas.
People didn’t believe Alas. But, everyday Alas kept repeating the same words in order to avoid ridicule.
After a few days, a certain person began thinking, “Maybe, Alas is speaking the truth. What’s wrong in taking a chance? If I can also see the Heavens, it will be wonderful.”
So, he too pierced needles through his eyes and became blind. Unable to see the Heavens (and other things as well), the poor villager was terribly shocked. He immediately went to Alas and asked him, “Hey, you told me that if I pierce needles through my eyes, I will be able to see the Heavens. But, on the contrary, I can’t even see anything around me. What does all this mean?”
Alas replied smilingly, “My dear friend, you have become blind now. You won’t be able to see anything. But do not tell this to other people. If you do so, they all will laugh at you.
The person became sad on hearing this. After a while he spoke with a heavy heart, “Alas, you lied. You have cheated me. What shall I do now?”
Alas replied, “Now that you have become blind you should not speak the truth because people will laugh at you. So, the only alternative left is that you too can see the Heavens now”
The poor villager, in order to avoid being ridiculed by others, began telling the other villagers that it was a wonderful experience for him to have pierced needles through his eyes. And, he too could see the Heavens now. The poor villager continued, “Alas is a great scholar. He has done me a great favour.”
On listening to him, the villagers were astonished. Gradually, they began believing Alas and the other villager. Soon, others followed and, gradually, all the villagers became blind and kept saying that they too could see the Heavens so that other villagers would not laugh at their foolish act.
